synopsis

the film follows the adventures of a group of friends through the eyes of charles a debonair but faux pas prone englishman played by grant who is smitten by carrie an attractive american played by andie macdowell whom charles repeatedly meets at weddings and at a funeral

the first wedding is that of angus and laura timothy walker and sara crowe charles and his collection of single friends are concerned that they will never get married at this wedding charles meets carrie for the first time and spends the night with her but he regards it as a one night stand carrie teases him that now they have slept together they will also have to get married but it is clear that she too sees their liaison as a one off

the second wedding is that of bernard and lydia david haig and sophie thompson a couple who got together at the previous wedding this sequence features rowan atkinson in a small role as an inexperienced priest the reception is not an enjoyable one for charles first he encounters carrie who subsequently introduces charles to her fiance sir hamish banks a wealthy politician from scotland next charles finds himself seated at a table with several ex girlfriends as well as bumping into henrietta known among charles friends as duckface with whom he had a difficult relationship in the past as the evening wears on charles inadvertently finds himself in bernard and lydias hotel suite and is forced to hide in a wardrobe after the newlyweds suddenly stumble into the room and engage in a sexual romp on the bed believing that carrie has left the reception with hamish charles later runs into her without her fiance shortly after another emotional encounter with henrietta charles and carrie end up spending the night together

during the interim period charles receives an invitation to carries wedding in scotland and while shopping for a present in london accidentally bumps into her in a shop and ends up helping select her wedding dress carrie also astonishes him with a list of more than thirty sexual partners he learns he is number 32 he later confesses to her that he loves her and if her wedding is unsuccessful he would like to have a relationship with her an offer she politely declines

the third wedding is that of carrie and hamish at a scottish castle charles attends depressed at the prospect of carrie marrying hamish as the reception gets under way gareth instructs his friends to go forth and seek potential mates fionas brothertom james fleet stumbles through an attempt to connect with the ministers wife while charles flatmate scarlett charlotte coleman strikes up a conversation with a tall attractive american as charles watches carrie and hamish dance as husband and wife he reveals his feelings about carrie to his friend fiona kristin scott thomas who is crestfallen and confesses that she has always loved charles since they first met years ago charles is surprised and empathetic but does not requite her love at the wedding charless friend gareth simon callow dies suddenly of a heart attack gareths partner matthew john hannah in one of his first screen roles is called but does not reach him before he dies

the funeral is that of gareth at the funeral matthew recites the poem funeral blues stop all the clocks by w h auden commemorating his relationship with gareth bbc website qa with a four weddings actor accessed may 18 2008 simon callow makes explicit reference to the fact that his character was gay john hannah unofficial website  accessed may 18 2008 interview from the inspectors call by gareth mclean the scotsman april 17 2000 i hope i convinced people within the industry that i was more than just fortunate to get the part of matthew i did a mini series after that faith which was a success and madagascar skin a low budget film which i loved but unfortunately got stuck with this arthouse label then people questioned my reason for playing another gay character  but i thought that was ridiculous referencing to the fact that the character of matthew was gay after the funeral charles and tom have a discussion about whether finding that one true love is just a futile effort and speculate that perhaps gareth and matthew were the only real married couple within their group

the fourth wedding is that of charles who has decided to marry henrietta out of desperation however prior to the ceremony carrie arrives and reveals to charles that she and hamish are no longer together at the altar when the vicar asks if anyone knows a reason why the couple should not marry charless deaf brother david david bower uses sign language to announce that charles doesnt love henrietta henrietta punches charles and the wedding is abruptly halted

at the end carrie visits charles who is recovering from the debacle to apologize for attending charles confesses that he has finally realized the person he would like to spend his life with is not the woman he was about to marry he doesnt want to get married at all but he does want carrie to be his partner the couple then vow that they will never ever marry

the end credits include a montage of photographs documenting the futures of other characters in the film all are shown on their individual wedding days except for fiona who is shown satirically with prince charles the happily unmarried carrie and charles are pictured with their baby boy
