geography



the city lies roughly at the geographical centre of denmark on the peninsula of jutland forests reach from the south into the city to within a kilometre 06 mi of the city centre because the city has grown around the forest and some areas are completely surrounded by the city such as risskov the city is built mostly around the harbour which is predominantly industrial although a large recreational marina is situated south of it as an extension

while some of the highest points in denmark are close to the city the general landscape is typically hilly interspersed with forests and meadows the city itself is very hilly north of the centre for danish standards that is see highest hill denmark the coastline consists mainly of sandy beaches but stony areas are not uncommon the immediate coastal regions are not heavily populated due to a national policy of keeping residences inland rather than crowding the coast

the city lies at the junction of railway lines from all parts of the country to the south west about  by rail lies a picturesque region that contains the gudenå several larger lakes extend west from the skanderborg railway junction and rise to heights exceeding at himmelbjerget the railway traverses this district of moorland and woodland to silkeborg

history

the bishopric of aarhus dates back to at least 951 and archaeological findings date back some 1300 years to viking times the city itself is presumably older than 770 ad making aarhus the oldest big city in scandinavia the favorable central position of the city within denmark afforded it trade from germany the baltic countries the greater peninsula of jutland and the communities on the many smaller islands in its vicinity which meant that trade always had a great significance to the town a significance which is still true today

the city did not expand outwards until the late 19th century and aalborg remained the largest city on the peninsula until the 1920s the relatively fast albeit late growth of the city can be ascribed to the general tendencies of a population moving from rural to urban areas during the industrial revolution industrialisation meant that proximity to trade routes became more important giving the harbour city some advantages over other nearby cities as new industries came into existence



name

during the middle ages the city was called arus and in icelandic chronicles it was known as áróss it is a compound of the two words ār genitive of ā river modern danish å and ōss mouth obsolete in modern danish in modern icelandic this word is still used for river delta the city is located on the mouth of the small river århus å å being the danish word for a small river

through regular sound development medieval danish arus became aars or oes a form which persisted in the dialects of the surrounding parishes until the 20th century in 1406 aarhus became prevalent in the written sources and gradually became the norm in the 17th century aarhus is probably a remodelling after the numerous low german place names in husen possibly as a result of the influence of german merchants

the city is mentioned for the first time by adam of bremen who states that reginbrand bishop of the church of aarhus harusa participates in a church meeting in the city of ingelham in germanygesta hammaburgensis ecclesiae 24

17th 18th centuries

during the wars of the 17th century it is probable that the city suffered in a significant way fortifications still exist south of the city as a reminder of the german imperial campaigns between 1627 and 1629 in 1644 sweden taxed the city harshly and between 1657 and 1659 it was occupied by swedish troops on several occasions

in spite of these and other misfortunes such as plague and city wide fires aarhus was still quite a significant city in denmark due to its favourable geographical position which was of significant importance for trading trade came mainly from the inland of jutland but also from norway lübeck amsterdam england france and spain in the middle of the 18th century the trade fleet consisted of approximately 100 ships

19th century

in the 19th century the city gained more independence from the dominance of copenhagen and hamburg while it had been the third largest city in jutland during the early 19th century its population surpassed randers in 1840 and in 1850 ålborg thus becoming the largest city in jutland and the second largest in denmark
