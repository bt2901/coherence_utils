function

aaron’s function included the duties of speaker and implied personal dealings with the egyptian royal court on behalf of moses who was always the central moving figure the part played by aaron in the events that preceded the exodus was therefore ministerial and not directive he along with moses performed “signs” before his people which impressed them with a belief in the reality of the divine mission of the brothers exodus 415 16

at the command of moses he stretched out his rod in order to bring on the first three plagues exodus 719 8112 in the infliction of the remaining plagues he appears to have acted merely as the attendant of moses whose outstretched rod drew the divine wrath upon the pharaoh and his subjects exodus 923 101322 the potency of aaron’s rod had already been demonstrated by its victory over the rods of the egyptian magicians which it swallowed after all the rods alike had been turned into serpents exodus 79 during the journey in the wilderness aaron is not always prominent or active and he sometimes appears guilty of rebellious or treasonable conduct at the battle with amalek he is chosen with hur to support the hand of moses that held the “rod of god” exodus 179 when the revelation was given to moses at mount sinai he headed the elders of israel who accompanied moses on the way to the summit joshua however was admitted with his leader to the very presence of the lord while aaron and hur remained below to look after the people exodus 249 14 it was during the prolonged absence of moses that aaron yielded to the clamors of the people and made a golden calf as a visible image of the divinity who had delivered them from egypt exodus 321 6 it should be noted that in the account given of the same events in the quran aaron is not the idol maker and upon moses return begged his pardon as he had felt mortally threatened by the israelites quran 7142 152 at the intercession of moses aaron was saved from the plague which smote the people deuteronomy 920 exodus 3235 although it was to aaron’s tribe of levi that the work of punitive vengeance was committed exodus 3226

priesthood

at the time when the tribe of levi was set apart for the priestly service aaron was anointed and consecrated to the priesthood arrayed in the robes of his office and instructed in its manifold duties exodus 28 kjv exodus 29 kjv

on the very day of his consecration his sons nadab and abihu were consumed by fire from the lord for having offered incense in an unlawful manner leviticus 10 kjv

scholarly consensus is that in aarons high priesthood the sacred writer intended to describe a model the prototype so to say of the jewish high priest god on mount sinai instituting a worship also instituted an order of priests according to the patriarchal customs the firstborn son in every family used to perform the functions connected with gods worship it might have been expected consequently that reubens family would be chosen by god for the ministry of the new altar however according to the biblical narrative it was aaron who was the object of gods choice to what jealousies this gave rise later has been indicated above the office of the aaronites was at first merely to take care of the lamp that should ever burn before the veil of the tabernacle exodus 2721 a more formal calling soon followed exodus 281 aaron and his sons distinguished from the common people by their sacred functions were likewise to receive holy vestments suitable to their office

aaron offered the different sacrifices and performed the many ceremonies of the consecration of the new priests according to the divine instructions exodus 29 and repeated these rites for seven days during which aaron and his sons were entirely separated from the rest of the people when on the eighth day the high priest had inaugurated his office of sacrifice by killing the animals he blessed the people very likely according to the prescriptions of numbers 624 26httpwwwclaudemariottinicomblog200603priestly benediction numbers 624 26html and with moses entered into the tabernacle so as to take possession thereof as they came forth and blessed the people and the glory of the lord appeared to all the multitude and behold a fire coming forth from the lord devoured the holocaust and the fat that was upon the altar which when the multitude saw they praised the lord falling on their faces leviticus 923 24 so was the institution of the aaronic priesthood inaugurated and solemnly ratified by the lord

rebellion of korah

from the time of the sojourn at mount sinai where he became the anointed priest of israel aaron ceased to be the minister of moses his place being taken by joshua he is mentioned in association with miriam in a jealous complaint against the exclusive claims of moses as the lord’s prophet the presumption of the murmurers was rebuked and miriam was smitten with tzaraas aaron entreated moses to intercede for her at the same time confessing the sin and folly that prompted the uprising aaron himself was not struck with the plague on account of sacerdotal immunity and miriam after seven days’ quarantine was healed and restored to favor numbers 12 micah 64 a prophet in judaism mentions moses aaron and miriam as the leaders of israel after the exodus a judgment wholly in accord with the tenor of the narratives in the present instance it is made clear by the express words of the oracle numbers 126 8 that moses was unique among men as the one with whom the lord spoke face to face the failure to recognize or concede this prerogative of their brother was the sin of miriam and aaron

the validity of the exclusive priesthood of the family of aaron was attested after the ill fated rebellion of korah who was a first cousin of aaron when the earth had opened and swallowed up the leaders of the insurgents numbers 1625 35 eleazar the son of aaron was commissioned to take charge of the censers of the dead priests and when the plague had broken out among the people who had sympathized with the rebels aaron at the command of moses took his censer and stood between the living and the dead till the plague was stayed numbers 171 15 1636 50

another memorable transaction followed each of the tribal princes of israel took a rod and wrote his name upon it and the twelve rods were laid up over night in the tent of meeting on the morrow aaron’s rod was found to have budded and blossomed and borne ripe almonds numbers 178 the miracle proved merely the prerogative of the tribe of levi but now a formal distinction was made in perpetuity between the family of aaron and the other levites while all the levites and only levites were to be devoted to sacred services the special charge of the sanctuary and the altar was committed to the aaronites alone numbers 181 7 the scene of this enactment is unknown nor is the time mentioned

death

aaron like moses was not permitted to enter canaan with the othersjewish encyclopedia the reason alleged is that the two brothers showed impatience at meribah kadesh in the last year of the desert pilgrimage numbers 2012 13 when they or rather moses brought water out of a rock to quench the thirst of the people the action was construed as displaying a want of deference to the lord since they had been commanded to speak to the rock whereas moses struck it with the wonder working rod numbers 207 11 of the death of aaron we have two accounts the principal one gives a detailed statement to the effect that soon after the above incident aaron with his son eleazar and moses ascended mount hor there moses stripped him aaron of his priestly garments and transferred them to eleazar aaron died on the summit of the mountain and the people mourned for him thirty days numbers 2022 29 compare 3338 39 the other account is found in deut x 6 where moses is reported as saying that aaron died at mosera and was buried there mosera is not on mount hor since the itinerary in numbers 3331 37 records seven stages between moseroth mosera and mount hor

rabbinical literature

the older prophets and prophetical writers beheld in their priests the representatives of a religious form inferior to the prophetic truth men without the spirit of god and lacking the will power requisite to resist the multitude in its idolatrous proclivitiesjewishencyclopediacom aaron thus aaron the first priest ranks below moses he is his mouthpiece and the executor of the will of god revealed through moses although it is pointed outsifra wa yiḳra 1 that it is said fifteen times in the pentateuch that “the lord spoke to moses and aaron” under the influence of the priesthood which shaped the destinies of the nation under persian rule a different ideal of the priest was formed as is learned from malachi 24 7 and the prevailing tendency was to place aaron on a footing equal with moses “at times aaron and at other times moses is mentioned first in scripture—this is to show that they were of equal rank” says mekilta בא 1 expressly infers this when introducing in his record of renowned men the glowing description of aaron’s ministration

death of aaron

in fulfilment of the promise of peaceful life symbolized by the pouring of oil upon his head leviticus rabbah x midrash teh cxxxiii 1 aarons death as described in the haggadah was of a wonderful tranquillityjewishencyclopediacom aaron accompanied by moses his brother and by eleazar his son aaron went to the summit of mount hor where the rock suddenly opened before him and a beautiful cave lit by a lamp presented itself to his view take off thy priestly raiment and place it upon thy son eleazar said moses and then follow me aaron did as commanded and they entered the cave where was prepared a bed around which angels stood go lie down upon thy bed my brother moses continued and aaron obeyed without a murmur then his soul departed as if by a kiss from god the cave closed behind moses as he left and he went down the hill with eleazar with garments rent and crying alas aaron my brother thou the pillar of supplication of israel when the israelites cried in bewilderment where is aaron angels were seen carrying aarons bier through the air a voice was then heard saying the law of truth was in his mouth and iniquity was not found on his lips he walked with me in righteousness and brought many back from sin malachi 26 he died according to seder olam rabbah ix r h 2 3a on the first of ab the pillar of cloud which proceeded in front of israels camp disappeared at aarons death see seder olam ix and r h 2b 3a the seeming contradiction between numbers 2022 et seq and deutronomy 106 is solved by the rabbis in the following manner aarons death on mount hor was marked by the defeat of the people in a war with the king of arad in consequence of which the israelites fled marching seven stations backward to mosera where they performed the rites of mourning for aaron wherefore it is said there at mosera died aaronsee mek beshallaḥ wayassa i tan huḳḳat 18 yer soṭah i 17c and targum yer num and deut on the abovementioned passages

the rabbis also dwell with special laudation on the brotherly sentiment which united aaron and moses when the latter was appointed ruler and aaron high priest neither betrayed any jealousy instead they rejoiced in one anothers greatness when moses at first declined to go to pharaoh saying o my lord send i pray thee by the hand of him whom thou wilt send exodus 413 he was unwilling to deprive aaron his brother of the high position the latter had held for so many years but the lord reassured him saying behold when he seeth thee he will be glad in his heart  indeed aaron was to find his reward says simon bar yochai for that heart which had leaped with joy over his younger brothers rise to glory greater than his was decorated with the urim and thummim which were to be upon aarons heart when he goeth in before the lord canticles rabbah i 10 moses and aaron met in gladness of heart kissing each other as true brothers exodus 427 compare song of songs 81 and of them it is written behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity psalms 1331 of them it is said mercy and truth are met together righteousness and peace have kissed each other psalms 8510 for moses stood for righteousness according to deuteronomy 3321 and aaron for peace according to  again mercy was personified in aaron according to deuteronomy xxxiii 8 and truth in moses according to numbers xii 7 tan shemot ed buber 24 26

when moses poured the oil of anointment upon the head of aaron aaron modestly shrank back and said who knows whether i have not cast some blemish upon this sacred oil so as to forfeit this high office then the shekhinah spake the words behold the precious ointment upon the head that ran down upon the beard of aaron that even went down to the skirts of his garment is as pure as the dew of hermon  sifra shemini milluim tan korah ed buber 14

moses and aaron

according to tanhumaed buber 212 aaron’s activity as a prophet began earlier than that of mosesjewishencyclopediacom aaron hillel held aaron up as an example saying “be of the disciples of aaron loving peace and pursuing peace love your fellow creatures and draw them nigh unto the law”abot 112 this is further illustrated by the tradition preserved in abot de rabbi natan 12 sanhedrin 6b and elsewhere according to which aaron was an ideal priest of the people far more beloved for his kindly ways than was moses while moses was stern and uncompromising brooking no wrong aaron went about as peacemaker reconciling man and wife when he saw them estranged or a man with his neighbor when they quarreled and winning evil doers back into the right way by his friendly intercourse the mourning of the people at aaron’s death was greater therefore than at that of moses for whereas when aaron died the whole house of israel wept including the women numbers 2029 moses was bewailed by “the sons of israel” only  even in the making of the golden calf the rabbis find extenuating circumstances for aaronsanhedrin 7a his fortitude and silent submission to the will of god on the loss of his two sons are referred to as an excellent example to men how to glorify god in the midst of great afflictionzebahim 115b especially significant are the words represented as being spoken by god after the princes of the twelve tribes had brought their dedication offerings into the newly reared tabernacle “say to thy brother aaron greater than the gifts of the princes is thy gift for thou art called upon to kindle the light and while the sacrifices shall last only as long as the temple lasts thy light shall last forever”tanhuma ed buber בהעלותך 6

recently the tradition that kohanim are actually descended from a single patriarch aaron was found to be apparently consistent with genetic testingskorecki et al 1997 the majority of kohanim but not all share a direct male lineage with a common y chromosome testing was done across sectors of the jewish population to see if there was any commonality between the y chromosomes of kohanim the results were found to cluster rather closely around a specific dna signature found in the semitic haplogroup j1 which the researchers named the cohen modal haplotype implying that many of the kohanim do share a distinctive common ancestry this information was also used to support the claim that the lemba a sub saharan tribe are in fact descendant from a group of jewish priests

aaron in islam

aaron is believed to be a prophet in islam and is known as harun which is the arabic name for aaron his role also found an analogue in the person of ali to whom muhammad said will you not be pleased that you will be to me like aaron was to moses sahih bukhari volume 5 book 57 number 56

a significant difference in the quran is the fact that aaron was not involved with the creation of the golden calf and made efforts to dissuade the israelites from worshiping it quran chp20 vr89

aaron in art history

depictions of aaron within art history are rare and their omission is somewhat puzzling given his importance in judaic and christian traditions other than aarons inclusion in the crowd of revelers around the golden calf ceremony—most notably in nicolas poussin’s “the adoration of the golden calf” ca 1633 34 national gallery london—there is little else the recent discovery in 1991 of pier francesco mola’s “aaron holy to the lord” ca 1650 private collection new york image available for study at fred r kline gallery archives adds significantly to the aaronic mythos the painting offers a dramatic deeply psychological portrayal of the single figure of aaron in his priestly garments celebrating yom kippur in the wilderness tabernacle the mola “aaron” is considered quite surprisingly the unique single figure of aaron to have been painted by a european old master artist circa 15th 18th centuries apigler barockthemen vol 1 although unknown to pigler the carefully rendered judaic iconographic details in the mola painting are rare and the subject itself may have importance in relationship to mid 17th century jewish history characterized by a controversial messianic movement involving a serious contender for a new messiah shabtai zvi whose influence was felt in jewish communities worldwide harris lenowitz the jewish messiahs it is highly probable that the zvi messianic phenomenon was noted by the catholic church as a possible threat to jesus their sanctified messiah it may be significant to note in considering the possible influence of the roman catholic church in choices of lay commissioned religious art during this period and considering as well the importance of aaron in the christian tradition that aaron holy to the lord was originally commissioned along with a now lost pendant of moses both from mola by the nobel colonna family wealthy catholic art patrons living in rome getty museum archives
