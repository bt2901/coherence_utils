the aardvark orycteropus afer afer from africa is a medium sized burrowing nocturnal mammal native to africa it is sometimes called antbear anteater cape anteater after the cape of good hope earth hog or earth pig the name comes from the afrikaansdutch for earth pig aarde earth varken pig because early settlers from europe thought it resembled a domesticated pig however the aardvark is not closely related to the pig rather it is the sole recent representative of the obscure mammalian order tubulidentata in which it is usually considered to form a single variable species of the genus orycteropus coextensive with the family orycteropodidae nor is the aardvark closely related to the south american anteater despite sharing some characteristics and a superficial resemblance the closest living relatives of the aardvark are the elephant shrews along with the sirenians hyraxes tenrecs and elephants

description

one of the most distinctive characteristics of the tubulidentata is as the name implies their teeth instead of having a pulp cavity each tooth has a cluster of thin upright parallel tubes of vasodentin a modified form of dentine with individual pulp canals held together by cementum the teeth have no enamel coating and are worn away and regrow continuously the aardvark is born with conventional incisors and canines at the front of the jaw which fall out and are not replaced adult aardvarks only have cheek teeth at the back of the jaw and have a dental formula of

genetically speaking the aardvark is a living fossil as its chromosomes are highly conserved reflecting much of the early eutherian arrangement before the divergence of the major modern taxa



the aardvark is vaguely pig like in appearance its body is stout with an arched back and is sparsely covered with coarse hairs the limbs are of moderate length the front feet have lost the pollex or thumb — resulting in four toes — but the rear feet have all five toes each toe bears a large robust nail which is somewhat flattened and shovel like and appears to be intermediate between a claw and a hoof the ears are disproportionately long and the tail is very thick at the base and gradually tapers the greatly elongated head is set on a short thick neck and the end of the snout bears a disc which houses the nostrils the mouth is small and tubular typical of species that feed on termites the aardvark has a long thin snakelike protruding tongue and elaborate structures supporting a keen sense of smell

an aardvarks weight is typically between 40 and 65nbspkg an aardvarks length is usually between 1 and 13 meters and can reach lengths of 22 meters

when its tail which can be up to 70 centimeters is taken into account the aardvark is pale yellowish gray in color and often stained reddish brown by soil the aardvarks coat is thin and the animals primary protection is its tough skin the aardvark has been known to sleep in a recently excavated ant nest which also serves as protection

behavior

the aardvark is nocturnal and is a solitary creature that feeds almost exclusively on ants and termites formicivore the only fruit eaten by aardvarks is the aardvark cucumber an aardvark emerges from its burrow in the late afternoon or shortly after sunset and forages over a considerable home range encompassing 10 to 30 kilometers swinging its long nose from side to side to pick up the scent of food when a concentration of ants or termites is detected the aardvark digs into it with its powerful front legs keeping its long ears upright to listen for predators and takes up an astonishing number of insects with its long sticky tongue as many as 50000 in one night have been recorded it is an exceptionally fast digger but otherwise moves fairly slowly its claws enable it to dig through the extremely hard crust of a termite or ant mound quickly avoiding the dust by sealing the nostrils when successful the aardvarks long as long as 30 centimeters tongue licks up the insects the termites biting or the ants stinging attacks are rendered futile by the tough skin its keen hearing warns it of predators lions leopards hyenas and pythons

aside from digging out ants and termites the aardvark also excavates burrows in which to live temporary sites are scattered around the home range as refuges and a main burrow is used for breeding main burrows can be deep and extensive have several entrances and can be as long as 13 meters the aardvark changes the layout of its home burrow regularly and from time to time moves on and makes a new one the old burrows are then inhabited by smaller animals like the african wild dog only mothers and young share burrows if attacked in the tunnel it will seal the tunnel off behind itself or turn around and attack with its claws

aardvarks only pair during the breeding season after a gestation period of 7 months a single cub weighing around 2nbspkg is born and is able to leave the burrow to accompany its mother after only two weeks and is eating termites at 14 weeks and is weaned by 16 weeks at six months of age it is able to dig its own burrows but it will often remain with the mother until the next mating season and is sexually capable by the season after that

aardvarks can live to be over 24 years old in captivity

the aardvarks main predators are lions leopards hunting dogs and pythons aardvarks can dig fast or run in zigzag fashion to elude enemies but if all else fails they will strike with their claws tail and shoulders sometimes flipping onto their backs to lash with all fours their thick skin also protects them to some extent

habitat

aardvarks live in subsaharan africa where there is suitable habitat for them to live such as savannas grasslands woodlands and bushland and available food ie ants and termites



mythology and popular culture

in african folklore the aardvark is much admired because of its diligent quest for food and its fearless response to the strong warlike soldier ant hausa magicians make a charm from the heart skin forehead and nails of the aardvark which they then proceed to pound together with the root of a certain tree wrapped in a piece of skin and worn on the chest the charm is said to give the owner the ability to pass through walls or roofs at night the charm is said to be used by burglars and those seeking to visit young girls without their parents permission



in english speaking countries the aardvark enjoys unusual notoriety since it is the first noun and often the first illustrated entry in many english dictionaries the main character of arthur a popular animated television series for children produced by wgbh tv and shown in more than 100 countries is an aardvarkhttpwwwwkyccomnewslocalnewsarticleaspxstoryid107290catid3
