the 1903 world series the first modern world series to be played in major league baseball matched the boston american league club against the pittsburgh pirates in a best of nine series with boston prevailing five games to three winning the last four

pittsburgh pitcher sam leever injured his shoulder while trap shooting so his teammate deacon phillippe had to pitch five complete games for pittsburgh phillippe won three of his games but it was not enough to overcome the club from the new american league boston pitchers bill dinneen and cy young led boston to victory

in game 1 phillippe set a world series record by striking out ten boston batters that record lasted barely one day as dinneen struck out eleven pittsburgh batters in game 2

honus wagner bothered by injuries batted only 6 for 27 222 in the series and committed six errors the shortstop was deeply distraught by his performance the following spring wagner who led the league in 1903 in batting average refused to send his portrait to a hall of fame for batting champions i was too bum last year he wrote i was a joke in that boston pittsburgh series what does it profit a man to hammer along and make a few hits when they are not needed only to fall down when it comes to a pinch i would be ashamed to have my picture up nowdevaleria p 138

in this world series the boston americans came back from a three games to one deficit winning the final four games in a best of nine series rather than the now standard best of seven such a comeback would not happen again until the pirates came back to defeat the washington senators in the 1925 world series and has happened only ten times in baseball history the pirates repeated this feat in 1979 against the baltimore orioles

much was made of the influence of bostons royal rooters who traveled to pittsburgh and sang their theme song tessie to distract the opposing players especially honus wagner boston would end up winning three out of the four games at pittsburgh

the pirates benevolent owner barney dreyfuss added his share of the gate receipts to the players share so the losing teams players actually finished with a larger individual share than the winning teams

the series brought the new american league prestige and proved its best could beat the best of the national league thus strengthening the demand for future world series competitions

background

earlier post season contests

the winners of the national league and american association had played post season contests from 1884 to 1891 called the championship of the united states and worlds championship series the series ended when the american association folded in 1891 the national league did hold a series of post season contests on and off between its first and second place finisher for the rest of the decade the brooklyn dodgers then called the superbas and pittsburgh pirates who finished first and second in 1900 played a five game playoff in pittsburgh that the dodgers won three games to onedevaleria dennis and jeanne burke honus wagner a biography pittsburgh university of pittsburgh press 1995 pp 85–86

a new league

in 1901 ban johnson president of the western league a minor league organization formed the american league to take advantage of the national leagues 1900 contraction from twelve teams to eight johnson and fellow owners raided the senior circuit and signed away many star players including cy young and jimmy collins johnson had a list of 46 national leaguers he targeted for the american league by 1902 all but one had made the jumpdevaleria p 99 the constant raiding however scotched the idea of a championship between the two leagues pirates owner barney dreyfuss whose team ran away with the 1902 national league pennant was open to a post season contest and even said he would allow the american league champion to stock his roster with all stars devaleria p 105 however johnson had spoken of putting a team in pittsburgh and even attempted to raid the pirates rosters in august 1902 which soured dreyfuss at the end of the season though the pirates played a group of american league all stars in a four game exhibition series winning two games to one with one tiedevaleria 102

the leagues finally called a truce in the winter of 1902–03 and formed the national commission to preside over organized baseball the following season the boston americans and pittsburgh pirates had secured their pennants by september that august dreyfuss challenged the american league to an eleven game championship series encouraged by johnson and national league president harry pulliam americans owner henry j killilea met with dreyfuss in pittsburgh in september and instead agreed to a best of nine championship with the first three games played in boston the next four in pittsburgh and the remaining two if necessary in bostondevaleria 122

one significant point about this agreement was that it was an arrangement primarily between the two clubs rather than a formal arrangement between the leagues in short it was a voluntary event a fact which would result in no series at all for 1904 and eventually to the formal establishment of the series as a compulsory event starting in 1905

the teams

the pirates won their third straight pennant in 1903 thanks to a powerful line up that included legendary shortstop honus wagner who hit 355 and drove in 101 runs player manager fred clarke who hit 351 and ginger beaumont who hit 341 and led the league in hits and runs the pirates pitching was weaker than it had been in previous years but boasted 24 game winner deacon phillippe and 25 game winner sam leeverdevaleria pp 119 123

the americans had a strong pitching staff led by cy young who went 28–9 in 1903 and became the all time wins leader that year bill dineen and long tom hughes right handers like young had won 21 games and 20 games each the boston outfield featuring chick stahl 274 buck freeman 287 104 rbis and patsy dougherty 331 101 runs scored was considered excellentdevaleria p124

although the pirates had dominated their league for the previous three years they went into the series riddled with injuries and plagued by bizarre misfortunes otto krueger the teams only utility player was beaned on september 19 and never fully played in the series 16 game winner ed doheny left the team three days later exhibiting signs of paranoia he was committed to an insane asylum the following monthdevaleria p 122 leever had been battling an injury to his pitching arm which he made worse by entering a trapshooting competition worst of all wagner who had a sore thumb throughout the season injured his right leg in september and was never 100 percent for the post seasondevaleria pp 122–123

some sources say boston were heavy underdogs boston bookies actually gave even odds to the teams and only because dreyfuss and other sports were alleged to have bet on pittsburgh to bring down the oddsdevaleria p 124 the teams were generally thought to be evenly matched with the americans credited with stronger pitching and the pirates with superior offense and fielding the outcome many believed hinged on wagners health if wagner does not play bet your money at two to one on boston said the sporting news but if he does play place your money at two to one on pittsburghquoted in devaleria p 124
