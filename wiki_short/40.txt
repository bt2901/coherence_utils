freedom of speech and expression

freedom of religion

freedom from want

united nations

the concept of the four freedoms became part of the personal mission undertaken by first lady eleanor roosevelt regarding her inspiration behind the united nations declaration of human rights general assembly resolution 217a 1948 indeed these four freedoms were explicitly incorporated into the preamble to the universal declaration of human rights which reads whereas disregard and contempt for human rights have resulted in barbarous acts which have outraged the conscience of mankind and the advent of a world in which human beings shall enjoy freedom of speech and belief and freedom from fear and want has been proclaimed the highest aspiration of the common people

disarmament

fdr called for a world wide reduction of armaments as a goal for the future days which we seek to make secure but one that was attainable in our own time and generation more immediately though he called for a massive build up of us arms production every realist knows that the democratic way of life is at this moment being directly assailed in every part of the world… the need of the moment is that our actions and our policy should be devoted primarily—almost exclusively—to meeting this foreign peril … the immediate need is a swift and driving increase in our armament production … i also ask this congress for authority and for funds sufficient to manufacture additional munitions and war supplies of many kinds to be turned over to those nations which are now in actual war with aggressor nations … let us say to the democracies …we shall send you in ever increasing numbers ships planes tanks guns …
