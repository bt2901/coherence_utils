in march 1528 the citizens of aarau allowed the introduction of protestantism at the urging of the bernese a growth in population during the 16th century led to taller buildings and denser construction methods early forms of industry developed at this time however unlike in other cities no guilds were formed in aarau

starting in the early 18th century the textile industry was established in aarau german immigration contributed to the citys favorable conditions in that they introduced the cotton and silk factories these highly educated immigrants were also responsible for education reform and the enlightened revolutionary spirit that developed in aarau

the textile industry in aarau broke down in about 1850 because of the protectionist tariff policies of neighboring states other industries had developed by that time to replace it including the production of mathematical instruments shoes and cement beginning in 1900 numerous electrical enterprises developed by the 1960s more citizens worked in service industries or for the canton level government than in manufacturing during the 1980s many of the industries left aarau completely

origin of the name

the buildings in the old city originate on the whole from building projects during the 16th century when nearly all the middle age period buildings were replaced or expanded the architectural development of the city ended in the 18th century when the city began to expand beyond its still existing wall most of the buildings in the suburb date from this time

the schlössli small castle rore tower and the upper gate tower have remained nearly unchanged since the 13th century the schlössli is the oldest building in the city it was already founded at the time of the establishment of the city shortly after 1200 the exact date is not known city hall was built around rore tower in 1515

the upper gate tower stands beside the southern gate in the city wall along the road to lucerne and bern the jail has been housed in it since the middle ages a carillon was erected in the tower in the middle of the 20th century the bells for which were provided by the centuries old bell manufacturers of aarau

more than half of the workers in aarau live in the citys suburbs or farther away in the surrounding area this leads to a busy rush hour and regular traffic jams statistically aarau has the most jobs per capita of any swiss city

the small scale of aarau causes it to continually expand the borders of its growth the urban center lies in the middle of the golden triangle between zurich bern and basel and aarau is having increasing difficulty in maintaining the independence of its economic base from the neighboring large cities the idea of merging aarau with its neighboring suburbs has been recently discussed in hopes of stopping the slowly progressing losses
