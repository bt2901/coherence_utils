fossils from latin fossus literally having been dug up are the preserved remains or traces of animals plants and other organisms from the remote past the totality of fossils both discovered and undiscovered and their placement in fossiliferous fossil containing rock formations and sedimentary layers strata is known as the fossil record the study of fossils across geological time how they were formed and the evolutionary relationships between taxa phylogeny are some of the most important functions of the science of paleontology

such a preserved specimen is called a fossil if it is older than some minimum age most often the arbitrary date of 10000 years ago frequently asked questions about paleontology san diego natural history museum hence fossils range in age from the youngest at the start of the holocene epoch to the oldest from the archaean eon several billion years old the observations that certain fossils were associated with certain rock strata led early geologists to recognize a geological timescale in the 19th century the development of radiometric dating techniques in the early 20th century allowed geologists to determine the numerical or absolute age of the various strata and thereby the included fossils

like extant organisms fossils vary in size from microscopic such as single bacterial cells



only one micrometer in diameter to gigantic such as dinosaurs and trees many meters long and weighing many tons a fossil normally preserves only a portion of the deceased organism usually that portion that was partially mineralized during life such as the bones and teeth of vertebrates or the chitinous exoskeletons of invertebrates preservation of soft tissues is rare in the fossil record fossils may also consist of the marks left behind by the organism while it was alive such as the footprint or feces coprolites of a reptile these types of fossil are called trace fossils or ichnofossils as opposed to body fossils finally past life leaves some markers that cannot be seen but can be detected in the form of biochemical signals these are known as chemofossils or biomarkers

places of exceptional fossilization

fossil sites with exceptional preservation — sometimes including preserved soft tissues — are known as lagerstätten these formations may have resulted from carcass burial in an anoxic environment with minimal bacteria thus delaying decomposition lagerstätten span geological time from the cambrian period to the present worldwide some of the best examples of near perfect fossilization are the cambrian maotianshan shales and burgess shale the devonian hunsrück slates the jurassic solnhofen limestone and the carboniferous mazon creek localities

earliest fossiliferous sites

earth’s oldest fossils are the stromatolites consisting of rock built from layer upon layer of sediment and other precipitants based on studies of now rare but living stromatolites specifically certain blue green bacteria the growth of fossil stromatolitic structures was biogenetically mediated by mats of microorganisms through their entrapment of sediments however abiotic mechanisms for stromatolitic growth are also known leading to a decades long and sometimes contentious scientific debate regarding biogenesis of certain formations especially those from the lower to middle archaean eon

it is most widely accepted that stromatolites from the late archaean and through the middle proterozoic eon were mostly formed by massive colonies of cyanobacteria formerly known as blue green algae and that the oxygen byproduct of their photosynthetic metabolism first resulted in earth’s massive banded iron formations and subsequently oxygenated earth’s atmosphere

even though it is extremely rare microstructures resembling cells are sometimes found within stromatolites but these are also the source of scientific contention the gunflint chert contains abundant microfossils widely accepted as a diverse consortium of 20 ga microbesknoll a h barghorn es awramik sm 1978 new organisms from the aphebian gunflint iron formation journal of paleontology52 1074 1082

in contrast putative fossil cyanobacteria cells from the 34 ga warrawoona group in western australia are in dispute since abiotic processes cannot be ruled outlowe d r 1994 abiological origin of described stromatolites older than 32 ga geology 22 387 390 confirmation of the warrawoona microstructures as cyanobacteria would profoundly impact our understanding of when and how early life diversified pushing important evolutionary milestones further back in time reference the continued study of these oldest fossils is paramount to calibrate complementary molecular phylogenetics models

developments in interpretation of the fossil record

ever since recorded history began and probably before people have noticed and gathered fossils including pieces of rock and minerals that have replaced the remains of biologic organisms or preserved their external form fossils themselves and the totality of their occurrence within the sequence of earths rock strata is referred to as the fossil record

the fossil record was one of the early sources of data relevant to the study of evolution and continues to be relevant to the history of life on earth paleontologists examine the fossil record in order to understand the process of evolution and the way particular species have evolved

explanations

various explanations have been put forth throughout history to explain what fossils are and how they came to be where they were found many of these explanations relied on folktales or mythologies in china the fossil bones of ancient mammals including homo erectus were often mistaken for “dragon bones” and used as medicine and aphrodisiacs in the west the presence of fossilized sea creatures high up on mountainsides was seen as proof of the biblical deluge

greek scholar aristotle realized that fossil seashells from rocks were similar to those found on the beach indicating the fossils were once living animals leonardo da vinci concurred with aristotles view that fossils were the remains of ancient lifecorrelating earths history paul r janke in 1027 the persian geologist ibn sina known as avicenna in europe explained how the stoniness of fossils was caused in the book of healing however he rejected the explanation of fossils as organic remainsintute timeline fossils subject science engineering and technology aristotle previously explained it in terms of vaporous exhalations which ibn sina modified into the theory of petrifying fluids succus lapidificatus which was elaborated on by albert of saxony in the 14th century and accepted in some form by most naturalists by the 16th century ibn sina gave the following explanation for the origin of fossils from the petrifaction of plants and animals

more scientific views of fossils emerged during the renaissance for example leonardo da vinci noticed discrepancies with the use of the biblical flood narrative as an explanation for fossil origins

william smith 1769 1839 an english canal engineer observed that rocks of different ages based on the law of superposition preserved different assemblages of fossils and that these assemblages succeeded one another in a regular and determinable order he observed that rocks from distant locations could be correlated based on the fossils they contained he termed this the principle of faunal succession

smith who preceded charles darwin was unaware of biological evolution and did not know why faunal succession occurred biological evolution explains why faunal succession exists as different organisms evolve change and go extinct they leave behind fossils faunal succession was one of the chief pieces of evidence cited by darwin that biological evolution had occurred

georges cuvier came to believe that most if not all the animal fossils he examined were remains of species that were now extinct this led cuvier to become an active proponent of the geological school of thought called catastrophism near the end of his 1796 paper on living and fossil elephants he said

all of these facts consistent among themselves and not opposed by any report seem to me to prove the existence of a world previous to ours destroyed by some kind of catastrophegeorges cuvier fossil discoveries

biological explanations

early naturalists well understood the similarities and differences of living species leading linnaeus to develop a hierarchical classification system still in use today it was darwin and his contemporaries who first linked the hierarchical structure of the great tree of life in living organisms with the then very sparse fossil record darwin eloquently described a process of descent with modification or evolution whereby organisms either adapt to natural and changing environmental pressures or they perish

when charles darwin wrote on the origin of species by means of natural selection or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life the oldest animal fossils were those from the cambrian period now known to be about 540 million years old the absence of older fossils worried darwin about the implications for the validity of his theories but he expressed hope that such fossils would be found noting that only a small portion of the world is known with accuracy darwin also pondered the sudden appearance of many groups ie phyla in the oldest known cambrian fossiliferous stratadarwin c 1859 on the origin of species chapter 10 on the imperfection of the geological record

further discoveries

since darwins time the fossil record has been pushed back to between 23 and 35 billion years before the presentschopf jw 1999 cradle of life the discovery of the earths earliest fossils princeton university press princeton nj most of these precambrian fossils are microscopic bacteria or microfossils however macroscopic fossils are now known from the late proterozoic the ediacaran biota also called vendian biota dating from 575 million years ago collectively constitutes a richly diverse assembly of early multicellular eukaryotes

the fossil record and faunal succession form the basis of the science of biostratigraphy or determining the age of rocks based on the fossils they contain for the first 150 years of geology biostratigraphy and superposition were the only means for determining the relative age of rocks the geologic time scale was developed based on the relative ages of rock strata as determined by the early paleontologists and stratigraphers

since the early years of the twentieth century absolute dating methods such as radiometric dating including potassiumargon argonargon uranium series and for very recent fossils carbon 14 dating have been used to verify the relative ages obtained by fossils and to provide absolute ages for many fossils radiometric dating has shown that the earliest known stromatolites are over 34 billion years old various dating methods have been used and are used today depending on local geology and context and while there is some variance in the results from these dating methods nearly all of them provide evidence for a very old earth approximately 46 billion years

modern view

the fossil record is life’s evolutionary epic that unfolded over four billion years as environmental conditions and genetic potential interacted in accordance with natural selection the earth’s climate tectonics atmosphere oceans and periodic disasters invoked the primary selective pressures on all organisms which they either adapted to or they perished with or without leaving descendants modern paleontology has joined with evolutionary biology to share the interdisciplinary task of unfolding the tree of life which inevitably leads backwards in time to the microscopic life of the precambrian when cell structure and functions evolved earth’s deep time in the proterozoic and deeper still in the archaean is only recounted by microscopic fossils and subtle chemical signalsknoll a 2003 life on a young planet princeton university press princeton nj molecular biologists using phylogenetics can compare protein amino acid or nucleotide sequence homology ie similarity to infer taxonomy and evolutionary distances among organisms but with limited statistical confidence the study of fossils on the other hand can more specifically pinpoint when and in what organism branching occurred in the tree of life modern phylogenetics and paleontology work together in the clarification of science’s still dim view of the appearance of life and its evolution during deep time on earthpaul crc and donovan sk 1998 an overview of the completeness of the fossil record in the adequacy of the fossil record paul crc and donovan sk eds 111 131 john wiley new york

example of modern development

an example of modern paleontological progress is the application of synchrotron x ray tomographic techniques to early cambrian bilaterian embryonic microfossils that has recently yielded new insights of metazoan evolution at its earliest stages the tomography technique provides previously unattainable three dimensional resolution at the limits of fossilization fossils of two enigmatic bilaterians the worm like markuelia and a putative primitive protostome pseudooides provide a peek at germ layer embryonic development these 543 million year old embryos support the emergence of some aspects of arthropod development earlier than previously thought in the late proterozoic the preserved embryos from china and siberia underwent rapid diagenetic phosphatization resulting in exquisite preservation including cell structures this research is a notable example of how knowledge encoded by the fossil record continues to contribute otherwise unattainable information on the emergence and development of life on earth for example the research suggests markuelia has closest affinity to priapulid worms and is adjacent to the evolutionary branching of priapulida nematoda and arthropodadonoghue pcj bengtson s dong x gostling nj huldtgren t cunningham ja yin c yue z peng f and stampanoni m 2006 synchrotron x ray tomographic microscopy of fossil embryos nature 442 680 683

rarity of fossils

fossilization is an exceptionally rare occurrence because most components of formerly living things tend to decompose relatively quickly following death in order for an organism to be fossilized the remains normally need to be covered by sediment as soon as possible however there are exceptions to this such as if an organism becomes frozen desiccated or comes to rest in an anoxic oxygen free environment there are several different types of fossils and fossilization processes

due to the combined effect of taphonomic processes and simple mathematical chance fossilization tends to favor organisms with hard body parts those that were widespread and those that existed for a long time before going extinct on the other hand it is very unusual to find fossils of small soft bodied geographically restricted and geologically ephemeral organisms because of their relative rarity and low likelihood of preservation

larger specimens macrofossils are more often observed dug up and displayed although microscopic remains microfossils are actually far more common in the fossil record

some casual observers have been perplexed by the rarity of transitional species within the fossil record the conventional explanation for this rarity was given by darwin who stated that the extreme imperfection of the geological record combined with the short duration and narrow geographical range of transitional species made it unlikely that many such fossils would be found simply put the conditions under which fossilization takes place are quite rare and it is highly unlikely that any given organism will leave behind a fossil eldredge and gould developed their theory of punctuated equilibrium in part to explain the pattern of stasis and sudden appearance in the fossil record furthermore in the strictest sense nearly all fossils are transitional due to the improbability that any given fossil represents the absolute termination of an evolutionary path

types of preservation

permineralization

permineralization occurs after burial as the empty spaces within an organism spaces filled with liquid or gas during life become filled with mineral rich groundwater and the minerals precipitate from the groundwater thus occupying the empty spaces this process can occur in very small spaces such as within the cell wall of a plant cell small scale permineralization can produce very detailed fossils for permineralization to occur the organism must become covered by sediment soon after death or soon after the initial decaying process the degree to which the remains are decayed when covered determines the later details of the fossil some fossils consist only of skeletal remains or teeth other fossils contain traces of skin feathers or even soft tissues this is a form of diagenesis

casts and molds

in some cases the original remains of the organism have been completely dissolved or otherwise destroyed when all that is left is an organism shaped hole in the rock it is called an external mold if this hole is later filled with other minerals it is a cast an internal mold is formed when sediments or minerals fill the internal cavity of an organism such as the inside of a bivalve or snail

replacement and recrystallization

replacement occurs when the shell bone or other tissue is replaced with another mineral in some cases mineral replacement of the original shell occurs so gradually and at such fine scales that microstructural features are preserved despite the total loss of original material a shell is said to be recrystallized when the original skeletal minerals are still present but in a different crystal form as from aragonite to calcite

compression fossils

compression fossils such as those of fossil ferns are the result of chemical reduction of the complex organic molecules composing the organisms tissues in this case the fossil consists of original material albeit in a geochemically altered state often what remains is a carbonaceous film this chemical change is an expression of diagenesis

bioimmuration

bioimmuration is a type of preservation in which a skeletal organism overgrows or otherwise subsumes another organism preserving the latter or an impression of it within the skeletontaylor pd 1990 preservation of soft bodied and other organisms by bioimmuration a review palaeontology 331 17 usually it is a sessile skeletal organism such as a bryozoan or an oyster which grows along a substrate covering other sessile encrusters sometimes the bioimmured organism is soft bodied and is then preserved in negative relief as a kind of external mold there are also cases where an organism settles on top of a living skeletal organism which grows upwards preserving the settler in its skeleton bioimmuration is known in the fossil record from the ordovicianwilson ma palmer tj and taylor pd 1994 earliest preservation of soft bodied fossils by epibiont bioimmuration upper ordovician of kentucky lethaia 27 269 270 to the recenttaylor pd 1990 preservation of soft bodied and other organisms by bioimmuration a review palaeontology 331 17

to sum up fossilization processes proceed differently for different kinds of tissues and under different kinds of conditions

trace fossils

trace fossils are the remains of trackways burrows bioerosion eggs and eggshells nests droppings and other types of impressions fossilized droppings called coprolites can give insight into the feeding behavior of animals and can therefore be of great importance

microfossils

microfossil is a descriptive term applied to fossilized plants and animals whose size is just at or below the level at which the fossil can be analyzed by the naked eye a commonly applied cut off point between micro and macro fossils is 1 mm although this is only an approximate guide microfossils may either be complete or near complete organisms in themselves such as the marine plankters foraminifera and coccolithophores or component parts such as small teeth or spores of larger animals or plants microfossils are of critical importance as a reservoir of paleoclimate information and are also commonly used by biostratigraphers to assist in the correlation of rock units

resin fossils

fossil resin colloquially called amber is a natural polymer found in many types of strata throughout the world even the arctic the oldest fossil resin dates to the triassic though most dates to the tertiary the excretion of the resin by certain plants is thought to be an evolutionary adaptation for protection from insects and to seal wounds caused by damage elements fossil resin often contains other fossils called inclusions that were captured by the sticky resin these include bacteria fungi other plants and animals animal inclusions are usually small invertebrates predominantly arthropods such as insects and spiders and only extremely rarely a vertebrate such as a small lizard preservation of inclusions can be exquisite including small fragments of dna

pseudofossils

pseudofossils are visual patterns in rocks that are produced by naturally occurring geologic processes rather than biologic processes they can easily be mistaken for real fossils some pseudofossils such as dendrites are formed by naturally occurring fissures in the rock that get filled up by percolating minerals other types of pseudofossils are kidney ore round shapes in iron ore and moss agates which look like moss or plant leaves concretions spherical or ovoid shaped nodules found in some sedimentary strata were once thought to be dinosaur eggs and are often mistaken for fossils as well

living fossils

living fossil is an informal term used for any living species which is apparently identical or closely resembles a species previously known only from fossils that is it is as if the ancient fossil had come to life

this can be a a species or taxon known only from fossils until living representatives were discovered such as the lobe finned coelacanth primitive monoplacophoran mollusk and the chinese maidenhair tree or b a single living species with no close relatives such as the new caledonian kagu or the sunbittern or c a small group of closely related species with no other close relatives such as the oxygen producing primoidial stromatolite inarticulate lampshell lingula many chambered pearly nautilus rootless whisk fern armored horseshoe crab and dinosaur like tuatara that are the sole survivors of a once large and widespread group in the fossil record
