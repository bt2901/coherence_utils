alfred edward housman  26 march 1859 – 30 april 1936 usually known as a e housman was an english classical scholar and poet best known for his cycle of poems a shropshire lad lyrical and almost epigrammatic in form the poems were mostly written before 1900 their wistful evocation of doomed youth in the english countryside in spare language and distinctive imagery appealed strongly to late victorian edwardian and georgian taste and to many early twentieth century english composers beginning with arthur somervell both before and after the first world war through its song setting the poetry became closely associated with that era and with shropshire itself

housman was counted one of the foremost classicists of his age and has been ranked as one of the greatest scholars of all timea man who turned out to be not only the great english classical scholar of his time but also one of the few real and great scholars anywhere at any time charles oscar brink english classical scholarship historical reflections on bentley porson and housman james clarke  co oxford oxford university press new york 1986 p149 he established his reputation publishing as a private scholar and on the strength and quality of his work was appointed professor of latin at ucl and later at cambridge his editions of juvenal manilius and lucan are still considered authoritative

life

housman was born in fockbury a hamlet on the outskirts of bromsgrove in worcestershire the eldest of seven children of a country solicitor his mother died on his twelfth birthday and subsequently her place was taken by his stepmother lucy an elder cousin of his fathers whom he latter married in 1873 his brother laurence housman and sister clemence housman also became writers

housman was educated first at king edwards school birmingham then bromsgrove school where he acquired a strong academic grounding and won prizes for his poetry in 1877 he won an open scholarship to st johns college oxford where he studied classics although by nature rather withdrawn housman formed strong friendships with two roommates moses jackson and a w pollard jackson became the great love of housmans life though the latters feelings were not reciprocated as jackson was heterosexualsummers 1995 p371 page 2004 housman obtained a first class in classical moderations in 1879 but his immersion in textual analysis particularly with propertius led him to neglect ancient history and philosophy which formed part of the greats curriculum and thus he failed to obtain even a pass degree though some explain housmans unexpected failure in his final exams as due to jacksons rejectioncunningham 2000 p981 most biographers adduce a variety of reasons indifference to philosophy overconfidence in his praeternatural gifts a contempt for inexact learning and enjoyment of idling away his time with jackson conjoined with news of his fathers desperate illness as the more immediate and germane causesnorman page macmillan london 1983 ppae housman a critical biographypp43 46richard perceval graves ae housman the scholar poet charles scribners new york 1979 pp52 55charles oscar brink english classical scholarship ibidpp152f the failure left him with a deep sense of humiliation and a determination to vindicate his genius

after oxford jackson got a job as a clerk in the patent office in london and arranged a job there for housman as well they shared a flat with jacksons brother adalbert until 1885 when housman moved in to lodgings of his own moses jackson moved to india in 1887 when jackson returned briefly to england in 1889 to marry housman not only was not invited to the wedding but knew nothing about it until the couple had left the country adalbert jackson died in 1892 housman continued pursuing classical studies independently and published scholarly articles on such authors as horace propertius ovid aeschylus euripides and sophocles he gradually acquired such a high reputation that in 1892 he was offered the professorship of latin at ucl which he accepted many years later the ucl academic staff common room was dedicated to his memory as the housman room

although housmans sphere of responsibilities as professor included both latin and greek he put most of his energy into the study of latin classics in 1911 he took the kennedy professorship of latin at trinity college cambridge where he remained for the rest of his life it was unusual at the time for an oxford man such as housman to be appointed to a post at cambridge during 1903–1930 he published his critical edition of maniliuss astronomicon in five volumes he also edited works of juvenal 1905 and lucan 1926 many colleagues were unnerved by his scathing critical attacks on those whom he found guilty of shoddy scholarship to his students he appeared as a severe reticent remote authority however quite contrary to his usual outward appearance he allowed himself several hedonistic pleasures he enjoyed gastronomy and flying in airplanes and frequently visited francepage 2004 where he read books which were banned in britain as pornographicgraves 1979 155 a fellow don described him as being descended from a long line of maiden auntscritchley 1988

housman found his true vocation in classical studies and treated poetry as a secondary activity he never spoke about his poetry in public until 1933 when he gave a lecture the name and nature of poetry in which he argued that poetry should appeal to emotions rather than to the intellect he died aged 77 three years later in cambridge his ashes are buried near st laurences church ludlow shropshire

poetry

a shropshire lad

during his years in london a e housman completed his cycle of 63 poems a shropshire lad after several publishers had turned it down he published it at his own expense in 1896 the volume surprised both his colleagues and students at first selling slowly it rapidly became a lasting success and its appeal to english musicians see below had helped to make it widely known before world war i when its themes struck a powerful chord with english readers a shropshire lad has been in print continuously since may 1896

the poems are pervaded by deep pessimism and preoccupation with death without religious consolation housman wrote most of them while living in highgate london before ever visiting that part of shropshire about thirty miles from his home which he presented in an idealised pastoral light as his land of lost contentaehousman a shropshire lad xl housman himself acknowledged the influence of the songs of william shakespeare the scottish border ballads and heinrich heine but specifically denied any influence of greek and latin classics in his poetry

later collections

in the early 1920s when moses jackson was dying in canada housman wanted to assemble his best unpublished poems so that jackson could read them before his death these later poems mostly written before 1910 show a greater variety of subject and form than those in a shropshire lad but lack the consistency of his previously published work he published them as last poems 1922 because he felt his inspiration was exhausted and that he should not publish more in his lifetime this proved true

after his death housmans brother laurence published further poems which appeared in more poems 1936 and collected poems 1939 housman also wrote a parodic fragment of a greek tragedy in english and humorous poems published posthumously under the title unkind to unicorns

john sparrowcollected poems penguin harmondsworth 1956 preface by john sparrow found statements in a letter written late in housmans life which describe how his poems came into existence

poetry was for him a morbid secretion as the pearl is for the oyster the desire or the need did not come upon him often and it came usually when he was feeling ill or depressed then whole lines and stanzas would present themselves to him without any effort or any consciousness of composition on his part sometimes they wanted a little alteration sometimes none sometimes the lines needed in order to make a complete poem would come later spontaneously or with a little coaxing sometimes he had to sit down and finish the poem with his head that  was a long and laborious process 



sparrow himself adds how difficult it is to achieve a satisfactory analysis may be judged by considering the last poem in a shropshire lad of its four stanzas housman tells us that two were given him ready made one was coaxed forth from his subconsciousness an hour or two later the remaining one took months of conscious composition no one can tell for certain which was which

de amicitia about friendship

in 1942 laurence housman also deposited an essay entitled a e housmans de amicitia in the british library with the proviso that it was not to be published for 25 years the essay discussed a e housmans homosexuality and his love for jacksonsummers ed 1995 371 despite the conservative nature of the times housman as distinct from the prudence of his public life was quite open in his poetry and especially his a shropshire lad about his deeper sympathies in poem 30 of that sequence for instance we read that

others i am not the first

have willed more mischief than they durst

as the voice speaks of how fear contended with desire

in more poems he buries his love for moses jackson in the very act of commemorating it as his feelings of love break his friendship and must be carried silently to the gravesummers ed 1995372 

because i liked you better

than suits a man to say

it irked you and i promised

to throw the thought away

to put the world between us

we parted stiff and dry

goodbye said you forget me

i will no fear said i

if here where clover whitens

the dead mans knoll you pass

and no tall flower to meet you

starts in the trefoiled grass

halt by the headstone naming

the heart no longer stirred

and say the lad that loved you

was one that kept his wordaehousman more poems jonathan cape london 1936 p48

his poem oh who is that young sinner with the handcuffs on his wrists written after the trial of oscar wilde addressed more general social injustice towards homosexualityhousman 1937 213 in the poem the prisoner is suffering for the colour of his hair a natural given attribute which in a clearly coded reference to homosexuality is reviled as nameless and abominable recalling the legal phrase peccatum horribile inter christianos non nominandum the horrible sin not to be named amongst christians

housman in other art forms

music and art song

housmans poetry especially a shropshire lad provided texts for a significant number of british and in particular english composers in the first half of the 20th century the national pastoral and traditional elements of his style resonated with similar trends in english music the first was probably the cycle a shropshire lad set by arthur somervell in 1904 who had begun to develop the concept of the english song cycle in his version of tennysons maud a little previously ralph vaughan williams produced his most famous settings of six songs the cycle on wenlock edge for string quartet tenor and piano dedicated to gervase elwes in 1909w and r elwes gervase elwes the story of his life grayson and grayson london 1935 195 97 and it became very popular after elwes recorded it with the london string quartet and frederick b kiddle in 1917 between 1909 and 1911 george butterworth produced settings in two collections or cycles as six songs from a shropshire lad and bredon hill and other songs he also wrote an orchestral tone poem on a shropshire lad first performed at leeds festival under arthur nikisch in 1912a eaglefield hull a dictionary of modern music and musicians dent london 1924 73

butterworths death on the somme in 1916 was considered a great loss to english music ivor gurney another most important setter of housman ludlow and teme a work for voice and string quartet and a song cycle on housman works both of which won the carnegie awardeaglefield hull 1924 205 experienced emotional breakdowns which were popularly but wrongly believed to have arisen from shell shock hence the fatalistic strain of the poems and the earlier settings foreshadowed responses to the universal bereavement of the first world war and became assimilated into them this was reinforced when their foremost interpreter and performer gervase elwes who had initiated the music festivals at brigg in lincolnshire at which percy grainger and others had developed their collections of country musicw and r elwes 1935 156 166 died in a horrific accident in 1921 elwes had been closely identified with english wartime morale having given six benefit performances of the dream of gerontius on consecutive nights in 1916 and many concerts in france in 1917 for british soldiersw  r elwes 1935 244 55

among other composers who set housman songs were john ireland song cycle land of lost content michael head eg ludlow fair graham peel a famous version of in summertime on bredon ian venables songs of eternity and sorrow and the american samuel barber eg with rue my heart is laden gerald finzi repeatedly began settings though never finished any even composers not directly associated with the pastoral tradition such as arnold bax lennox berkeley and arthur bliss were attracted to housmans poetry a 1976 catalogue listed 400 musical settings of housmans poemspalmer and banfield 2001 housmans poetry impacted on british music in a way comparable to that of walt whitman in the music of delius vaughan williams and others housmans works provided song texts whitmans the texts for larger choral works

the impact in music of housmans poetry has not been limited in time place or style the contemporary new zealand composer david downes includes a setting of march on his cd the rusted wheel of things

singersongwriters such as warwick lobban who melodifies housmans xiv the farms of home lie lost in even have also drawn much from the great poets work
