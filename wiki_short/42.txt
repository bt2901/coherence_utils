a fox is an animal belonging to any one of about 27 species of which only 12 actually belong to the vulpes genus or true foxes of small to medium sized canids characterized by possessing a long narrow snout and a bushy tail or brush by far the most common and widespread species of fox is the red fox vulpes vulpes although various species are found on almost every continent the presence of fox like carnivores all over the globe has led to their appearance in both popular culture and folklore see foxes in culture

general characteristics

in the wild foxes can live for up to 10 years but most foxes only live for 2 to 3 years due to hunting road accidents and diseases in captivity they can survive for 10 years foxes are generally smaller than other members of the family canidae such as wolves jackals and domestic dogs dogs male foxes weigh on average 59nbspkilograms 13nbsplb and vixens female foxes weigh less at 52nbspkilograms 115nbsplb fox like features typically include an acute muzzle a fox face and bushy tail other physical characteristics vary according to their habitat for example the fennec fox and other species of foxes adapted to life in the desert such as the kit fox has large ears and short fur whereas the arctic fox has small ears and thick insulating fur

another example is the red fox which has a typical auburn pelt the tail normally ending with white marking

unlike many canids foxes are not usually pack animals however this does happen in some rare cases typically they are solitary opportunistic feeders that hunt live prey especially rodents using a pouncing technique practiced from an early age they are usually able to kill their prey quickly foxes also gather a wide variety of other foods ranging from grasshoppers to fruit and berries

foxes are normally extremely wary of humans and are not kept as indoor pets with the exception of the fennec however the silver fox was successfully domesticated in russia after a 45 year selective breeding program this selective breeding also resulted in physical and behavioral traits appearing that are frequently seen in domestic cats dogs and other animals pigmentation changes floppy ears and curly tails early canid domestication the fox farm experiment

classification

canids commonly known as foxes include members of the following genera

alopex arctic fox although the definitive mammal taxonomy list as well as genetic evidence places it in vulpes not its own genus alopex

cerdocyon crab eating fox

chrysocyon maned wolf in english aguara guazú big fox in guarani and zorro rojizo reddish fox one of several names used by spanish speakers

dusicyon falkland islands fox

lycalopex six south american species

otocyon bat eared fox

urocyon gray fox island fox and cozumel fox

vulpes including twelve species of true vulpine foxes including the red fox v vulpes tibetan sand fox vulpes ferrilata and their closest kin

diet

the diet of foxes is largely made up of invertebrates however it also includes rodents rabbits and other small mammals reptiles such as snakes amphibians grasses berries fruit fish birds eggs and all other kinds of small animals many species are generalist predators but some such as the crab eating fox are more specialist most species of foxes generally consume around 1 kg of food every day foxes cache excess food burying it for later consumption usually under leaves snow or soil

conservation

foxes are readily found in cities and cultivated areas and depending upon species seem to adapt reasonably well to human presence

red foxes have been introduced into australia which lacks similar carnivores and the introduced foxes prey on native wildlife some to the point of extinction a similar introduction occurred in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in temperate north america where european reds vulpes vulpes were brought to the colonies for fox hunting where they devastated the american red fox population through more aggressive hunting and breeding interbreeding with american reds traits of the european red eventually pervaded the gene pool leaving european and american foxes now virtually identical

other fox species do not reproduce as readily as the red fox and are endangered in their native environments key among these are the crab eating fox cerdocyon thous and the african bat eared fox other foxes such as fennec foxes are not endangered

foxes have been successfully employed to control pests on fruit farms while leaving the fruit intactfoxes on fruit farms

historians believe foxes were imported into non native environments long before the colonial era the first example of the introduction of the fox into a new habitat by humans seems to be neolithic cyprus stone carvings representing foxes have been found in the early settlement of göbekli tepe in eastern turkey

relationships with humans

fox attacks on humans are not common but have been reported in november 2008 an incident in arizona usa was reported in which a jogger was attacked and bitten by a rabid foxattacked jogger takes fox for run bbc news

fox hunting

fox hunting is a controversial sport that originated in the united kingdom in the 16th century hunting with dogs is now banned in the united kingdom though hunting without dogs is still permitted the sport is practiced in several other countries including australia canada france ireland italy russia and the united states

domestication

the russian silver fox or domesticated silver fox is the result of nearly 50 years of experiments in the soviet union and russia to domesticate the silver morph of the red fox notably the new foxes not only became more tame but more dog like as well they lost their distinctive musky fox smell became more friendly with humans put their ears down like dogs wagged their tails when happy and began to vocalize and bark like domesticated dogs the breeding project was set up by the soviet scientist dmitri belyaev
