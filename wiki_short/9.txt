alfred elton van vogt april 26 1912january 26 2000 was a canadian born science fiction author regarded by some as one of the most popular and complex writers of the mid twentieth century golden age of the genre

science fictions golden age

born on a farm in edenburg a russian mennonite community east of gretna manitoba canada van vogt is one of the most popular and highly esteemed writers of the golden age of science fiction after starting his writing career by writing for true confession style pulp magazines like true story van vogt decided to switch to writing something he enjoyed science fiction

van vogts first published sf story black destroyer astounding science fiction july 1939 was inspired by on the origin of species by charles darwin the story depicted a fierce carnivorous alien stalking the crew of an exploration spaceship it was the cover story of this issue of astounding the issue often described as having ushered in the golden age of science fictionfor example peter nicholls  says the beginning of campbells particular golden age of sf can be pinpointed as the summer of 1939 and goes on to begin the discussion with the july 1939 issue lester del rey  comments that july was the turning point the story became an instant classic and eventually served as the inspiration for a number of science fiction movies in 1950 it was combined with war of nerves 1950 discord in scarlet 1939 and m33 in andromeda 1943 to form the novel the voyage of the space beagle 1950

in 1941 van vogt decided to become a full time writer quitting his job at the canadian department of national defence extremely prolific for a few years van vogt wrote a large number of short stories in the 1950s many of them were retrospectively patched together into novels or fixups as he called them a term which entered the vocabulary of science fiction criticism sometimes this was successful the war against the rull while other times the disparate stories thrown together made for a less coherent plot quest for the future

one of van vogts best known novels of this period is slan which was originally serialised in astounding science fiction september december 1940 using what became one of van vogts recurring themes it told the story of a 9 year old superman living in a world in which his kind are slain by homo sapiens

a sequel slan hunter was prepared by his widow lydia van vogt and kevin j anderson starting from an incomplete draft and outline left by the late van vogt it was published in july 2007 isbn 978 0765316752 lydia van vogt had already given permission to publish her introduction online

post war philosophy

in 1944 van vogt moved to hollywood california where his writing took on new dimensions after world war ii van vogt was always interested in the idea of all encompassing systems of knowledge akin to modern meta systems the characters in his very first story used a system called nexialism to analyze the aliens behaviour and he became interested in the general semantics of alfred korzybski

he subsequently wrote three novels merging these overarching themes the world of null a and the pawns of null a in the late 1940s and null a three in the early 1980s null a or non aristotelian logic refers to the capacity for and practice of using intuitive inductive reasoning compare fuzzy logic rather than reflexive or conditioned deductive logic

van vogt was also profoundly affected by revelations of totalitarian police states that emerged after world war ii he wrote a mainstream novel that was set in communist china the violent man 1962 he said that to research this book he had read 100 books about china into this book he incorporated his view of the violent male type which he described as a man who had to be right a man who instantly attracts women and who he said were the men who run the world

van vogt systematized his writing method using scenes of 800 words or so where a new complication was added or something resolved several of his stories hinge upon temporal conundra a favorite theme he stated that he acquired many of his writing techniques from three books narrative technique by thomas uzzell and the only two ways to write a story plus twenty problems of the short story writer both by john gallishaw alexei panshin the abyss of wonder man beyond man the early stories of a e van vogt

he said many of his ideas came from dreams and indeed his stories at times had the incoherence of dreams but at their best as in the science fantasy novel the book of ptath his works had all the vision and power a dream can impart throughout his writing life he arranged to be awakened every 90 minutes during his sleep period so he could write down his dreams charles platt who writes sf savoy books 1980

in the 1950s van vogt briefly became involved in l ron hubbards projects van vogt operated a storefront for dianetics the secular precursor to hubbards church of scientology in the los angeles area for a time before winding up at odds with hubbard and his methods his writing more or less stopped for some years a period in which he bitterly claimed to have been harassed and intimidated by hubbards followers in this period he was limited to collecting old short stories to form notable fixups like the mixed men 1952 the war against the rull 1959 the beast 1963 and the two novels of the linn cyle which were inspired like asimovs foundation series by the fall of the roman empire he resumed writing again in the 1960s mainly at frederik pohls invitation while remaining in hollywood with his second wife lydia bereginsky who cared for him through his declining years in this later period his novels were conceived and written as unitary works

on 26 january 2000 van vogt died in los angeles usa from alzheimers disease

recognition

in 1946 van vogt and his first wife edna mayne hull were co guests of honor at the fourth world science fiction convention

in 1980 van vogt received a casper award precursor to the canadian aurora awards for lifetime achievement in 1995 he was awarded the damon knight memorial grand master award by the science fiction writers of america in 1996 van vogt was recognized on two occasions the world science fiction convention presented him with a special award for six decades of golden age science fiction and the science fiction and fantasy hall of fame included him among its initial four inductees

critical praise

fellow science fiction author philip k dick has said that van vogts stories spurred his interest in science fiction with their strange sense of the unexplained that something more was going on than the protagonists realized

criticism

writer and critic damon knight wrote in 1945 that

most science fiction authors do not strive to be absolutely flawless scientifically preferring storytelling over accuracy despite this van vogt has been singled out by some critics for it examples

in cosmic encounter one result of the crash of an alien spaceship is the generation of a temperature of minus 50000 degrees well below absolute zero see negative temperature

the title of his story collection m33 in andromeda is incorrect m33 is in constellation triangulum m31 the andromeda galaxy is in andromeda
