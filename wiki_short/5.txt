serie a times 2001 2007

even as a successful serie a team they dont have the level of support the real gialloblu team of verona hellas have during the local derby games when its supposed to be chievo playing at home at their shared stadium the chievo fans have to go to the away end of the stadium the team only has a small support in the city managing only 4 5000 fans and are mainly kept afloat by money from television rights

a year with the cadetti 2007 08

colours and badge

the clubs historic colours were blue and white and not blue and yellow throughout italian football the only team recognised by most fans as gialloblu are the original team of verona hellas verona

the clubs historic nickname is gialloblu from the club colors of yellow and blue but is more often referred to today as the mussi volanti flying donkeys in the verona dialect of venetian local supporters often call the club simply ceo which is veronese for chievo the flying donkeys nickname was originally a derogatory term from a match chant sung by fans from crosstown rivals hellas verona who claimed chievo had stolen hellas colours name and stadium hellas fans also said that donkeys would fly before chievo made it to serie a however with later successes by chievo and contemporaneous serie b and serie c1 struggles for hellas verona chievo fans have now largely embraced the nickname as a badge of honour

the current club crest represents instead cangrande i della scala an ancient seignor from verona

supporters

the team have very weak support in the city of verona with no recognised ultras as most italian clubs have

even during their most successful seasons the crowds at the bentegodi stadium were small

as they enjoy serie a status and their famous city rival hellas are in the third division they have 6000 less season ticket holders than their lowly rivals

for the 200809 season chievo had now in actual fact over taken their local rivals for season ticket holders chievo have slowly increased their support each season and have a total of 8081 season ticket holders for the 0809 campaign whereas their rivals verona have a tally of 7890 season ticket holders
