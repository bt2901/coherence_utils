in several forms of football a forward pass is when the ball is thrown in the direction of the opponents end line

american and canadian football

in american and canadian football a forward pass—usually called simply a pass—consists of one offensive player throwing the football towards another downfield in the direction of the opponents end line this is permitted only once during a scrimmage down by the offensive team before team possession has changed provided the pass is thrown from in or behind the neutral zone an illegal forward pass incurs a 5 yard penalty and the loss of a down

if an eligible receiver on the passing team legally catches the ball it is a complete pass and the receiver may attempt to advance the ball if an opposing player legally catches the ball all defensive players are eligible receivers it is an interception that players team immediately gains possession of the ball and he may attempt to advance the ball toward his opponents goal if no player is able to legally catch the ball it is an incomplete pass and the ball becomes dead the moment it touches the ground it will then be returned to the original line of scrimmage for the next down if any player interferes with an eligible receivers ability to catch the ball it is pass interference which is a foul

the person passing the ball must be a member of the offensive team and the recipient of the forward pass must be an eligible receiver and must touch the passed ball before any ineligible player

the moment that a forward pass begins is important to the game the pass begins the moment the passers arm begins to move forward if the passer drops the ball before this moment it is a fumble and therefore a loose ball in this case anybody can gain possession of the ball before or after it touches the ground in canadian football if the passer drops the ball while his arm is moving forward it is an incomplete pass unless someone catches the ball before it hits the ground in which case it is a completed pass or an interception under american footballs tuck rule if the quarterback is attempting to bring the ball back to his body after starting a passing motion a lost ball may be considered an incomplete pass even if the quarterbacks arm is moving backward at the time

the quarterback generally either starts a few paces behind the line of scrimmage or drops back a few paces as the ball is snapped this places him in an area called the pocket which is a protective region formed by the offensive blockers up front and between the tackles on each side a quarterback who runs out of this pocket is said to be scrambling under nfl and ncaa rules once the quarterback moves out of the pocket and there is no good option for a forward pass the ball may be legally thrown away to prevent a sack nfhs high school rules do not allow for a passer to intentionally throw an incomplete forward pass to save loss of yardage or conserve time except for a spike to conserve time after a hand to hand snap if he throws the ball away while still in the pocket then a foul called grounding is assessed

if a forward pass is caught near a sideline or endline it is only a complete pass or an interception if a receiver catches the ball in bounds for a pass to be ruled in bounds the receivers feet must be in contact with the in bounds portion of the playing field or if the ball is caught in the air either one or two feet must touch the ground within the field boundaries after the ball is caught in the nfl the receiver must touch the ground with both feet but in most other codes—cfl ncaa and high school—one foot in bounds is enough

common to all gridiron codes is the notion of control—a receiver must demonstrate control of the ball in order to be ruled in possession of it while still in bounds as defined by his code if the receiver catches the ball but the official determines that he was still bobbling it prior to the end of the play then the pass will be ruled incomplete

history

early illegal  experimental passes

the forward pass had been attempted at least 30 years before the play was actually made legal vahe gregorian researched the history of the play for an article in the st louis post dispatch on september 4 2006 on the eve of the 100th anniversary of the first legal pass gregorian observed that passes “had been carried out successfully but illegally several times including the 1876 yale–princeton game in which yale’s walter camp threw forward to teammate oliver thompson as he was being tackled princeton’s protest one account said went for naught when the referee ‘tossed a coin to make his decision and allowed the touchdown to stand’nbsp”

the university of north carolina at chapel hill used the forward pass in an 1895 game against the university of georgia however the play was still illegal at the time bob quincy stakes carolinas claim in his 1973 book they made the bell tower chime



john heisman namesake of the heisman trophy wrote 30 years later that indeed the tar heels had given birth to the forward pass against the bulldogs uga it was conceived to break a scoreless deadlock and give unc a 6–0 win the carolinians were in a punting situation and a georgia rush seemed destined to block the ball the punter with an impromptu dash to his right tossed the ball and it was caught by george stephens who ran 70 yards for a touchdown



in a 1905 experimental game gregorian reports washburn and what would become wichita state used the pass before new rules allowing the play were approved in early 1906 1905 had been a bloody year on the gridiron the chicago tribune reported 18 players had been killed and 159 seriously injured that seasonjeffrey terence one hundred years of the forward pass cnsnews august 30 2006 there were moves to abolish the game but president theodore roosevelt personally intervened and demanded that the rules of the game be reformed in a meeting of more than 60 schools in late 1905 the commitment was made to make the game safer this meeting was the first step in the establishment of what would become the ncaa

the final meeting of the rules committee tasked with reshaping the game was held on april 6 1906 at which time the forward pass officially became a legal playnelson david m anatomy of a game football the rules and the men who made the game 1994 page 129

first legal pass

writing in his book the anatomy of a game football the rules and the men who made the game which was published posthumously in 1994 college football hall of fame coach david m nelson 1920–1991 states that e b cochems is to forward passing what the wright brothers are to aviation and thomas edison is to the electric light cochems the coach at saint louis university from 1906 through 1908 was the first to use the legal forward pass on september 5 1906 with bradbury robinson passing to jack schneider in a game at carroll college wisconsin st louis went on to win 22 0

first passing offense

the forward pass was a central feature of cochems revolutionary offensive scheme in that first season under the new rules his blue and white completed a perfect 11–0 season in which they outscored opponents 407–11 the highlight of the campaign was st louis shocking 31–0 thrashing of iowa coach nelson reports that eight passes were completed in ten attempts for four touchdowns in the iowa game the average flight distance of the passes was twenty yards nelson continues the last play demonstrated the dramatic effect that the forward pass was having on football st louis was on iowas thirty five yard line with a few seconds to play timekeeper walter mccormack walked onto the field to end the game when the ball was thrown twenty five yards and caught on the dead run for a touchdown

cochems said that the poor iowa showing resulted from its use of the old style play and its failure to effectively use the forward pass nelson writes iowa did attempt two basketball style forward passes

during the 1906 season robinson threw a sixty seven yard pass  and  schneider tossed a sixty five yarder considering the size shape and weight of the ball these were extraordinary passes

because st louis was geographically isolated from both the dominating teams and the major sports media newspapers of the era  all centered in and focused on the east  cochems groundbreaking offensive strategy was not picked up by the major teams pass oriented offenses would not be adopted by the eastern football powers until the next decade

but that does not mean that other teams in the midwest did not pick it up arthur schabinger quarterback for the college of emporia in kansas was reported to have regularly used the forward pass in 1910 coach h w bill hargiss presbies are said to have featured the play in a 17–0 victory over washburn universitykansas sports hall of fame arthur schabinger and in a 107 0 destruction of pittsburg state universitypittsburg state kansas football scores 1910

adoption by notre dame expands popularity

knute rockne and gus dorais worked on the pass while lifeguarding on a lake erie beach at cedar point in sandusky ohio during the summer of 1913 that year jesse harper notre dame head coach also showed how the pass could be used by a smaller team to beat a bigger one first utilizing it to defeat rival army after it was used against a major school on a national stage in this game the forward pass rapidly gained popularity

first pass in a professional game

the first forward pass in a professional football game may have been thrown in an ohio league game played on october 25 1906 the ohio league which traced its history to the 1890s was the predecessor of todays nfl according to robert w peterson in his book pigskin the early years of pro football the passer was george w peggy parratt probably the best quarterback of the era who played for the massillon ohio tigers one of pro footballs first franchisesmassillon tiger football history citing the professional football researchers association as his source peterson writes that parratt completed a short pass to end dan riley dan policowski in a game played at massillon against a team from west virginia since the tigers ran up a 61 to 0 score on the hapless mountain staters the pass played no important part in the resultpeterson robert w pigskin the early years of pro football pages 52 53 1997

according to national football league history it legalized the forward pass from anywhere behind the line of scrimmage on february 25 1933 before that rule change a forward pass had to be made from 5 or more yards behind the line of scrimmage

forward passes were first permitted in canadian football in 1929cflca history timeline 1920 but the tactic remained a minor part of the game for several years jack jacobs of the winnipeg blue bombers is recognized not for inventing the forward pass but for popularizing it in the western interprovincial football union thus changing the canadian game from a more run dominated game to the passing game as seen today

change in ball shape

specification of the size of the ball for the american game came in 1912 but it was still essentially a rugby ball increased use of the forward pass encouraged adoption of a narrower ball starting with changes in the 1920s which enhanced rifled throwing and also spiral puntingsee introduction a brief history of college football on the college football encyclopedia web site

rugby football

in the two codes of rugby union and league a forward pass is against the rules if the referee deems it accidental as it nearly always is this results in a scrum to the opposing team however deliberate forward passes result in a penalty

the team in possession must get behind the ball carrier or be ruled offside offside players will not be penalised as long as they remain inactive but if the ball is thrown to them then they become active and thus a scrum or penalty is awarded to the opposition to minimise the chances of this happening and to support the ball carrier team mates try to stay behind the player with the ball

a forward pass is defined in terms of whether the ball leaves the hand of the thrower in a forwards direction or not players may not even drop the ball forwards which would also result in a scrum
