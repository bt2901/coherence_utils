after the duke died without a male heir in 1447 fighting broke out to restore the so called ambrosian republic sforza received the seigniory of several cities of the duchy including pavia and lodi and started to carefully plan the conquest of the ephemeral republic allying with william viii of montferrat and again venice in 1450 after years of famine riots raged in the streets of milan and the citys senate decided to entrust to him the dukedom it was the first time that such a title was handed over by a lay institution while the other italian states gradually recognized sforza as the legitimate duke of milan he was never able to obtain official investiture from the holy roman emperor that did not come to the sforza dukes until 1494 when emperor maximilian formally invested francescos son lodovico also known as ludovico sforza as duke of milan

under his rule which was moderate and skillful sforza modernised the city and duchy he created an efficient system of taxation that generated enormous revenues for the government his court became a center of renaissance learning and culture and the people of milan grew to love him in milan he founded the ospedale maggiore restored the palazzo dellarengo and had the naviglio dadda a channel connecting with the adda river built

during sforzas reign florence was under the command of cosimo de medici and the two rulers became close friends this friendship eventually manifested in first the peace of lodi and then the italian league a multi polar defensive alliance of italian states that succeeded in stabilising almost all of italy for its duration after the peace sforza renounced part of the conquests in eastern lombardy obtained by his condottieri bartolomeo colleoni ludovico gonzaga and roberto sanseverino after 1451 as king alfonso of naples was among the signatories of the treaty sforza also abandoned his long support of the angevin pretenders to naples he also aimed to conquer genoa then an angevin possession when a revolt broke out there in 1461 he had spinetta campofregoso elected as doge as his puppet sforza occupied genoa and savona until 1464

sforza was the first european ruler to follow a foreign policy based on the concept of the balance of power and the first native italian ruler to conduct extensive diplomacy outside the peninsula to counter the power of threatening states such as france sforzas policies succeeded in keeping foreign powers from dominating italian politics for the rest of the century
