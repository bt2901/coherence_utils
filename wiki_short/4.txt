the 2001 world series the november series took place between the arizona diamondbacks and the new york yankees the diamondbacks won the best of seven series four games to three the series featured two extra inning games and three late inning comebacks it ended on a game seven walk off hit the first since edgar renter√≠as in 1997 in the form of a bloop single off the bat of luis gonzalez

this was the first world series ever played in the state of arizona while it was the third world series game seven to end on a hit with the bases loaded in the bottom of the final inning florida marlins 1997 minnesota twins 1991 as of 2008 this is the last world series in which the national league had home field advantage as they have yet to clinch it under the current all star game format this was the last world series not to feature a wild card team until 2008

randy johnson and curt schilling were the co mvps of the 2001 world series both combined for a 4 0 record and a 140 era striking out 45 yankees in 39 13 innings

background

the arizona diamondbacks breaking a record previously held by the florida marlins reached the series in just their fourth season of existence and took on the three time defending champion new york yankees who were trying to become the first team to win four straight titles since the yankees five consecutive titles from 1949 to 1953 additionally the series would be taking place in new york city only seven weeks after the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks representing a remarkable boost in morale for the fatigued city arizona captured the series four games to three thereby dethroning the defending world champions and earning their first title the diamondbacks win also ended the tongue in cheek curse of the balboni in 1985 kansas city royals player steve balboni set a team record with 36 home runs and the royals went on to win their first world series since that time no team who had employed a 36 home run player had won the world series the diamondbacks luis gonzalez with his 57 regular season home runs helped the team break the curse

arizona won the first two games at home handily but new york won the next three in close contests in yankee stadium including two dramatic ninth inning comebacks against arizona closer byung hyun kim arizona won the sixth game behind randy johnson who then came in to pitch in relief of curt schilling in game seven the diamondbacks won the game 3ndash2 with jay bell scoring the winning run on a bloop single by luis gonzalez in the bottom of the ninth inning off the yankees ace closer mariano rivera

the home team won every game in the series this had only happened twice before in 1987 and 1991 in both cases the minnesota twins won the series this was also until 2008 the most recent world series to feature two division winners all the series from 2002 through 2007 have featured at least one of the two wild card qualifiers

this series was also the subject of an hbo documentary nine innings from ground zero in 2004

despite the closeness of the series overall the diamondbacks outscored the yankees 37ndash14 over the entire series as a result of large margins of victory achieved by arizona in bank one ballpark relative to the one run margins at yankee stadium

in addition to breaking the curse of the balboni luis gonzalez helped put an end to the so called ex cubs factor jinx the d backs not only defied that jinx to win the series but two of the three ex cubs grace and gonzalez actively participated in the series winning rally

september 11 and the month of november

due to the postponement of games in september as a result of the september 11 2001 attacks the world series began saturday october 27 2001 the latest start date ever for a world series the series went seven games the last three of which were the first major league games other than exhibitions played in the month of november this was just the fourth time that no world series champion was decided within the traditional month of october the previous three occurrences were in 1904 no series 1918 series held in september due to world war i and 1994 no series due to work stoppage

game 7

sunday november 4 2001 at bank one ballpark in phoenix arizona

it was a matchup of two 20 game winners in the series finale that would crown a new champion clemens at 39 years old became the oldest game seven starter ever schilling had already started two games of the series and pitched his 300th inning of the season on just three days rest the two aces matched each other inning by inning and after seven full the game was tied at 1ndash1 the diamondbacks scored first in the 6th inning with a steve finley single and a danny bautista double bautista would be called out at third base the yankees responded with an rbi single from tino martinez which drove in derek jeter brenly stayed with schilling into the eighth and the move backfired as alfonso soriano hit a solo home run on an 0 2 pitch after schilling got one out he gave up a single to david justice and he left the game trailing 2ndash1 brenly brought in miguel batista to get out derek jeter and then in an unconventional move brought in the previous nights starter randy johnson who had thrown 104 pitches in relief to keep it a one run game it proved to be a smart move as johnson retired all four yankees he faced

with the yankees ahead 2ndash1 in the bottom of the eighth manager joe torre turned the game over to his ace closer mariano rivera for a two inning save rivera was one of the strongest closers in the game and had pitched brilliantly throughout the postseason up to that point rivera struck out the side in the eighth including arizonas sluggers luis gonzalez matt williams and danny bautista which lowered his era in the postseason to a major league best of 070 although he was sharp in the eighth this game would end in the third ninth inning comeback of the series

mark grace led off the inning with a single to center on a 1 0 pitch the real turning point was riveras errant throw to second base on a bunt attempt by damian miller on an 0 1 pitch putting runners on first and second derek jeter tried to reach for the ball but got tangled in the legs of pinch runner david dellucci who was sliding in an attempt to break up the double play rivera appeared to regain control when he fielded jay bells bunt and threw out dellucci at third base but third baseman scott brosius decided to hold the ball instead of throwing to first to attempt to complete the double play midre cummings was sent in to pinch run for damien miller with cummings at second and bell at first the next batter tony womack drove a double down the right field line on a 2 2 pitch that evened the score and blew the save bell went to third and the yankees pulled the infield and the outfield in as the potential winning run stood at third with less than two outs after rivera hit craig counsell with an 0 1 pitch the bases were loaded the winning run would be batted in with a gentle tap over the drawn in infield on an 0 1 pitch luis gonzalez lofted a soft single over derek jeter that barely reached the outfield grass plating jay bell with the winning run this ended new yorks bid for a fourth consecutive title and brought arizona its first championship in just its fourth year of existence making the diamondbacks the fastest expansion team to win a world series
