history

associazione sportiva roma was founded in the summer of 1927 by italo foschi who initiated the merger of three older italian football championship clubs from the city of rome roman alba audace and fortitudo the purpose of the merger wanted by the fascist dictator benito mussolini was to give the eternal city a strong club to rival that of the more dominant northern italian clubs of the time the only major roman club to resist the merger was lazio who were already a well established sporting society

the club played its earliest seasons at the motovelodromo appio stadium before settling in the working class streets of testaccio where it built an all wooden ground campo testaccio this was opened in november 1929 an early season in which roma made a large mark was the 1930–31 championship the club finished as runners up behind juventus captain attilio ferraris along with guido masetti fulvio bernardini and rodolfo volk were highly important players during this period

first title victory and decline

after a slump in league form and the departure of high key players roma eventually rebuilt their squad adding goalscorers such as the argentine enrique guaita under the management of luigi barbesino the roman club came close to their first title in 1935–36 finishing just one point behind champions bologna

roma returned to form after being inconsistent for much of the late 1930s roma recorded an unexpected title triumph in the 1941–42 season by winning their first ever scudetto title the eighteen goals scored by local player amedeo amadei were essential to the alfréd schaffer coached roma side winning the title at the time italy was involved in world war ii and roma were playing at the stadio del partito nazionale fascista

in the years just after the war roma were unable to recapture their league stature from the early 1940s roma finished in the lower half of serie a for five seasons in a row before eventually succumbing to their only ever relegation to serie b at the end of the 1950–51 season around a decade after their championship victory under future national team manager giuseppe viani promotion straight back up was achieved

after returning to serie a roma managed to stabilise themselves as a top half club again with players such as egisto pandolfini dino da costa and dane helge bronée their best finish of this period was under the management of englishman jesse carver when in 1954–55 they finished as runners up after udinese who originally finished second were relegated for corruption

although roma were unable to break into the top four during the following decade they did achieve some measure of cup success their first honour outside of italy was recorded in 1960–61 when roma won the inter cities fairs cup by beating birmingham city 4–2 in the finals a few years later roma won their first coppa italia trophy in 1963–64 by beating torino 1–0 their second coppa italia trophy was won in 1968–69 when it was competed in a small league like system giacomo losi set a roma appearance record during 1969 with 450 appearances in all competitions the record he set would last for 38 years

time of mixed fortunes

roma were able to add another cup to their collection in 1972 with a 3–1 victory over blackpool in the anglo italian cup during much of the 1970s romas appearance in the top half of serie a was sporadic the best place the club were able to achieve during the decade was third in 1974–75 notable players who turned out for the club during this period included midfielders giancarlo de sisti and francesco rocca

the dawning of a newly successful era in romas footballing history was brought in with another coppa italia victory they beat torino on penalties to win the 1979–80 cup roma would reach heights in the league which they had not touched since the 40s by narrowly and controversially finishing as runners up to juventus in 1980–81 former milan player nils liedholm was the manager at the time with prominent players such as bruno conti agostino di bartolomei roberto pruzzo and falcão

the second scudetto did not elude roma for much longer in 1982–83 the roman club won the title for the first time in 41 years amidst joyous celebrations in the capital the following season roma finished as runners up in italy and collected a coppa italia title they also finished as runners up in the european cup final of 1984 the european cup final with liverpool ended in a 1–1 draw with a goal from pruzzo but roma eventually lost the penalty shoot out romas successful run in the 1980s would finish with a runners up spot in 1985–86 and a coppa italia victory beating out sampdoria 3–2

after that a comparative decline began in the league one of the few league highs from the following period was a third place in 1987–88 at the start of the 1990s the club was involved in an all italian uefa cup final where they lost 2–1 to internazionale in 1991 the same season the club won its seventh coppa italia trophy and ended runners up to sampdoria in the supercoppa italiana aside from finishing runners up to torino in a coppa italia final the rest of the decade was largely sub par in the history of roma especially in the league where the highest they could manage was fourth in 1997–98

in the new millennium

roma returned to form in the 2000s starting the decade in great style by winning their third ever serie a title in 2000–01 the scudetto was won on the last day of the season by beating parma 3–1 edging out juventus by two points the clubs captain francesco totti was a large reason for the title victory and he would become one of the main heroes in the clubs history going on to break several club records other important players during this period included aldair cafu gabriel batistuta and vincenzo montellathumbleftfrancesco totti current captain with the 2007 08 coppa italia

the club attempted to defend the title in the following season but ended as runners up to juventus by just one point this would be the start of roma finishing as runners up many times in both serie a and coppa italia during the 2000s they lost out 4–2 to milan in the coppa italia final of 2003 and lost out to milan again by finishing second in serie a for the 2003–04 season

a serie a scandal was revealed during 2006 and roma were one of the teams not involved after punishments were handed out roma was re classified as runners up for 2005–06 the same season in which they finished second in the coppa italia losing to inter in the two following seasons roma finished as serie a runners up meaning that in the 2000s roma have finished in the top two positions more than any other decade in their history meanwhile in the uefa champions league during both of these seasons they reached the quarter finals before going out to manchester united after being thrashed 3 8 on aggregate despite the sloppy start in uefa champions league 2008–09 roma managed to reach the knockout stage ahead of chelsea in their group thus finishing for the first time in their history as winners of the group stage however the giallorossi would lose to arsenal fc in the knockout stage on penalty kicks ending their champions league campaign

romas colours of maroon red with a golden yellow trim represents the traditional colours of the eternal city the official seal of the comuni features the same colours the gold symbolizes god in roman catholicism while the maroon represents imperial dignity white shorts and black socks are usually worn with the maroon red shirt however in particularly high key games the shorts and socks are the same colour as the home shirt

the kit itself was originally worn by roman football club one of the three clubs who merged to form the current incarnation in 1927 because of the colours they wear roma are often nicknamed i giallorossi meaning the yellow reds romas away kit is traditionally white with a third kit changing colour from time to time

maybe because of modern sport marketing the last few years have seen the golden trim and details substituted by light orange modern alternate kits have included all orange and orange maroon versions

a popular nickname for the club is i lupi the wolves the animal has always featured on the clubs badge in different forms throughout their history currently the emblem of the team is the one which was used when the club was first founded it portrays the female wolf with the two infant brothers romulus and remus illustrating the myth of the creation of rome superimposed on a bipartite golden yellow over maroon red shield

in the myth from which the club take their nickname and logo the twins sons of mars and rhea silvia are thrown into the river tiber by their uncle amulius a she wolf saved the twins and looked after them eventually the two twins took revenge on amulius before falling out themselves romulus killed remus and as thus was made king of a new city named in his honour rome

supporters and rivalries

roma are the fifth most supported football club in italy behind juventus internazionale milan and napoli with around 6 of italian football fans supporting the club according to the doxa institute lexpresso’s research of april 2006 historically the largest section of roma supporters in the city of rome have come from the inner city and south parts which is the working class area of the city especially testaccio

the traditional ultras group of the club was commando ultrà curva sud commonly abbreviated as cucs this group was founded by the merger of many smallers groups and was considered one of the most historic in the history of european football however by the mid 1990s cucs had been usurped by rival factions and ultimately broke up since that time the curva sud of the stadio olimpico has been controlled by more right wing groups as roma ultras boys giovinezza and others the oldest group fedayn is apolitical however and politics is not the raison dêtre of roma just a part of their overall identity

the club anthem and motto is la roma non si discute si ama by local singer antonello venditti the title roughly means roma is not to be questioned it is to be loved and is sung before each match the song grazie roma by the same singer is played at the end of victorious home games recently the main riff of the white stripes song seven nation army has also become widely popular at games

in italian football roma are a club with many rivalries first and foremost is their rivalry with lazio the club who they share the stadio olimpico stadium with the derby between the two is called the derby della capitale it is amongst the most heated and emotional footballing rivalries in the world the fixture has seen some occasional instances of violence in the past including the death of lazio fan vincenzo paparelli in 1979–80 as a result of an emergency flare fired from the curva sud and the abandonment of a game in 2003 following unfounded rumours of a fatality which led to violence outside the stadium

with napoli roma also compete in the derby del sole rivalry meaning the derby of the sun the two cities are within close proximity to each other and the two clubs are the most successful in central and southern italy the fans also consider juventus milan and internazionale amongst their rivals

conflict with english fans

there have been a number of instances of conflict in recent years between some roma supporters and fans of english clubs pointing to an apparent dislike for english fans in some giallorossi supporters one reason forwarded for this is the 1984 defeat to liverpool in the european cup final at the stadio olimpico and the subsequent violence outside the stadium which saw a number of liverpool fans stabbed since then there have been further instances of some english supporters being attacked and stabbed in rome including incidents in 2001 when liverpool visited roma twice and subsequent clashes with middlesbrough fans in 2006 and manchester united fans in 2007 in march 2009 a coach carrying arsenal supporters was attacked by a group of roma ultras just outside the stadio olimpico the coachs windows were smashed and at least one person entered the vehicle letting off a flare and allegedly stabbing a supporter in the knee

arsenal had posted advice to their fans on how to avoid routes taken by roma ultras
