ayer was in fact not an atheist a common misconception but was rather sceptical about the meaningfulness of any religious discoursehe believed that religious language was unverifiable and as such literally nonsense consequently there is no god was for ayer as meaningless and metaphysical an utterance as god exists though ayer could not give assent to the declaration there is no god he was an atheist in the sense that he withheld assent from affirmations of gods existence however in language truth and logic he distinguishes himself from both agnostics and atheists by saying that both these stances take the statement god exists as a meaningful hypothesis which ayer himself does not that stance of a person who believes god denotes no verifiable hypothesis is sometimes referred to as igtheism defined in paul kurtz the new skepticism inquiry and reliable knowledge isbn 0 87975 766 3 page 194 and followed in the footsteps of bertrand russell by debating with the jesuit scholar frederick copleston on the topic of religion

he taught or lectured several times in the united states including serving as a visiting professor at bard college in the fall of 1987 at a party that same year held by fashion designer fernando sanchez ayer then 77 confronted mike tyson harassing the then little known model naomi campbell when ayer demanded that tyson stop the boxer said do you know who the fuck i am im the heavyweight champion of the world to which ayer replied and i am the former wykeham professor of logic we are both pre eminent in our field i suggest that we talk about this like rational menrogers 1999 page 344 ayer and tyson then began to talk while naomi campbell slipped out

shortly before his death in 1989 he received publicity after having an unusual near death experience which has often been misinterpreted as a move away from his lifelong and famous religious skepticism of the experience ayer first said that it slightly weakened my conviction that my genuine death  will be the end of me though i continue to hope that it will behttpwwwnear deathcomexperiencesatheists01html however a few days later he revised this saying what i should have said is that my experiences have weakened not my belief that there is no life after death but my inflexible attitude towards that belief ayer was the bbcs famous atheist front manhttpedgeorg3rdculturedennett06dennett06indexhtml ayer wrote an article in 1988 what i saw when i was deadhttpfindarticlescomparticlesmim1282isn20v40ai6701958 in 2001 dr jeremy george the attending physician told william cash who had written a play about ayer that ayer had confided to him i saw a divine being im afraid im going to have to revise all my books and opinionshttpwwwgonsalvesorgfavoriteatheisthtm

works

ayer is perhaps best known for popularising the verification principle in particular through his presentation of it in language truth and logic 1936 the principle was at the time at the heart of the debates of the so called vienna circle which ayer visited as a young guest and others including the leading light of the circle moritz schlick were already offering their own papers on the issueunanswerable questions ayers own formulation was that a sentence can only be meaningful if it has verifiable empirical import otherwise it is either analytical if tautologous or metaphysical ie meaningless or literally senseless he started work on the book at the age of 23page ix language truth and logic penguin 2001 and it was published when he was 26 ayers philosophical ideas were deeply influenced by those of the vienna circle and david hume his clear vibrant and polemical exposition of them makes language truth and logic essential reading on the tenets of logical empiricism the book is regarded as a classic of 20th century analytic philosophy and is widely read in philosophy courses around the world in it ayer also proposed that the distinction between a conscious man and an unconscious machine resolves itself into a distinction between different types of perceptible behaviourpage 140 language truth and logic penguin 2001 an argument which anticipates the turing test published in 1950 to test a machines capability to demonstrate intelligence consciousness

ayer wrote two books on the philosopher bertrand russell russell and moore the analytic heritage 1971 and russell 1972 he also wrote an introductory book on the philosophy of david hume and a short biography of voltaire

in 1972 73 ayer gave the gifford lectures at university of st andrews later published as the central questions of philosophy he still believed in the viewpoint he shared with the logical positivists that large parts of what was traditionally called philosophy including the whole of metaphysics theology and aesthetics were not matters that could be judged as being true or false and that it was thus meaningless to discuss them unsurprisingly this made him unpopular with several other philosophy departments in britain and his name is still reviled by many british professors to this day

in the concept of a person and other essays 1963 ayer made several striking criticisms of wittgensteins private language theory

ayers sense data theory in foundations of empirical knowledge was famously criticised by fellow oxonian j l austin in sense and sensibilia a landmark 1950s work of common language philosophy ayer responded to this in the essay has austin refuted the sense data theory which can be found in his metaphysics and common sense 1969
