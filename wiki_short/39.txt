four feather falls was the third puppet tv show produced by gerry anderson for granada television from an idea by barry gray

background

the series is set in the late 19th century western town of four feather falls kansas and features the adventures of its sheriff tex tucker in the first episode grandpa twink relates the story of how it all began to grandson little jake tex is riding up from the valley and comes across a lost and hungry indian boy makooya and saves him later when reunited with his father tex is given four magic feathers by indian chief kalamakooya as a reward for saving his son makooya two of these feathers allow his guns to swivel and fire automatically often while texs hands are raised and the other two allow his horse rocky and his dog dusty to speak english as tex his horse and dog are very thirsty kalamakooya also makes a waterfall where there had been no water before and so when the town was built it was named after texs feathers and the waterfalls

the show was made on a tight budget and could not afford sophisticated special effects to achieve the effect of the guns muzzle flashes small specks of black paint were carefully applied to the 35 mm negatives so that they would appear as white flashes on the prints

the series was the first to use an early version of andersons supermarionation puppetry process although the term wouldnt be coined until andersons next series supercar the original puppets produced for the series were made by christine glanville and had papier mâché heads and nothing moved so unless a puppet moved up and down you could not tell which one was talking this was unsatisfactory to anderson and he had some hollow fibre glass heads made with rods inside which could move the eyes though the puppets could not blink and wires which with a 12 volt current could move the mouths

the wires used to control the puppets were eight feet long and made of tungsten an improvement on the curtain wire used in the two earlier series and were only 1200 of an inch thick being shiny the wires had to be blackened optically the puppets were made one third life size with the puppeteers on a bridge eight feet above the set the horses moved by being pulled along on a trolley which meant you never saw their feet when they were moving

anderson approached singer michael holliday for a song for the show and paid him £2000 for it tommy reilly played the harmonicamouth organ music for it and for tex tucker when he played a mouth organ in the show a number of people had been brought in for the voices and denise bryer suggested her husband for the voice of tex tucker when anderson asked if he had had any stage experience she revealed that her husbands name was nicholas parsons anderson liked parsons voice and he got the job

the waterfall in the pilot episode was produced by making a model version of a library film of a waterfall available to anderson and fading from the model to the film of a waterfall running so the water seemed to appear by magic a lot of fantastic scenery and buildings were produced by reg hill his carpenter bill james and an assistant bob bell anderson said that bob bell got arrested while getting shrubs and trees for the show by taking cuttings in a local park reg hill meanwhile got hold of huge chunks of coal and painted them white for rocks for the mountain and desert scenery shortly afterwards polystyrene appeared and hill then carved his own rocks from this and painted them grey the show was filmed in a mansion on the side of the river thames in leatherhead the film used was not very sensitive and under the strong lights needed something would start to smoke if left there too long

pedro was introduced as a villain in the first show and was teamed up with fernando by the second show so someone to talk to to plan with to blame when things went wrong as they always did big ben was another villain who appeared from time to time and red scalp the renegade indian since it was a western show other villains turned up for just one episode

the characters of the town were grandpa twink who did little but rest in a chair little jake the only child in town ma jones who run the town store doc haggerty slim jim the bartender of the denison saloon marvin jackson the bank manager and dan morse the telegraphist other characters appeared from time to time for one episode often just visiting town
