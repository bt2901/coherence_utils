history

a quarry on the lousberg which was first used in neolithic times attests to the long occupation of the site of aachen

no larger settlements however have been found to have existed in this remote rural area distant at least 15nbspkm from the nearest road even in roman times up to the early medieval period when the place is mentioned as a kings mansion for the first time not long before charlemagne became ruler of the franks

since roman times the hot springs at aachen have been channeled into baths there are currently two places to take the waters at the carolus thermen complex and the bathhouse in burtscheidhttpwwwbad aachendedeutschgebietehtm spa districts in aachen german

there is some documentary proof that the romans named the hot sulphur springs of aachen aquis granum and indeed to this day the city is known in spanish as aquisgrán the name granus has lately been identified as that of a celtic deity

in french speaking areas of the former empire the word aquis evolved into the modern aix

middle ages

after roman times einhard mentions that in 765–6 pippin the younger spent both christmas and easter at aquis villa pépin le bref annales déginhard which must have been sufficiently equipped to support the royal household for several months in the year of his coronation as king of franks 768 charlemagne came to spend christmas at aachen for the first time he went on to remain there in a mansion which he may have extended although there is no source attesting any significant building activity at aachen in his time apart from the building of the palatine chapel in aachen since 1929 cathedral and the palatial presentation halls charlemagne spent most winters between 792 and his death in 814 in aachen which became the focus of his court and the political center of his empire after his death the king was buried in the church which he had built his original tomb has been lost while his alleged remains are preserved in the shrine where he was reburied after being declared a saint his saintliness however was never very widely acknowledged outside the bishopric of liège where he may still be venerated by tradition

in 936 otto i was crowned king of the kingdom in the collegiate church built by charlemagne over the next 500 years most kings of germany destined to reign over the holy roman empire were crowned king of the germans in aachen the last king to be crowned here was ferdinand i in 1531 during the middle ages aachen remained a city of regional importance due to its proximity to flanders achieving a modest position in the trade in woollen cloths favoured by imperial privilege the city remained a free imperial city subject to the emperor only but was politically far too weak to influence the policies of any of its neighbors the only dominion it held was that over the neighboring tiny territory of burtscheid which was ruled by a benedictine abbess and forced to accept that all of its traffic must pass through the aachener reich even in the late 18th century the abbess of burtscheid was prevented from building a road linking her territory to the neighbouring estates of the duke of jülich the city of aachen even deployed its handful of soldiers to chase away the road diggers

from the early 16th century aachen declined in importance in 1656 a great fire devastated aachenaachen 2006 in encyclopædia britannica retrieved december 9 2006 from encyclopædia britannica online it still remained a place of historical myth and became newly attractive as a spa by the middle of the 17th century not so much because of the effects of its hot springs on the health of its visitors but since aachen was then — and remained well into the 19th century — one of the centres of high level prostitution in europe traces of this hidden agenda of the citys history can be found in the 18th century guidebooks to aachen as well as to other spas the main indication for visiting patients ironically was syphilis only by the end of the 19th century had rheuma become the most important object of cures at aachen and burtscheid this explains why aachen was chosen as site of several important congresses and peace treaties the first congress of aachen often referred to as congress of aix la chapelle in english in 1668 leading to the first treaty of aachen in the same year which ended the war of devolution the second congress ended with the second treaty in 1748 finishing the war of the austrian succession the third congress took place in 1818 to decide the fate of occupied napoleonic france

18th century

by the middle of the 18th century industrialization had swept away most of the citys medieval rules of production and commerce although the entirely corrupt remains of the citys mediæval constitution were kept in place compare the famous remarks of georg forster in his ansichten vom niederrhein until 1801 when aachen became the chef lieu du département de la roer in napoléons first french empire in 1815 after the napoleonic wars the kingdom of prussia took over and the city became one of its most socially and politically backward centres until the end of the 19th century administered within the rhine province by 1880 the population was 80000 starting in 1840 the railway from cologne to belgium passed through aachen the city suffered extreme overcrowding and deplorable sanitary conditions up to 1875 when the mediæval fortifications were finally abandoned as a limit to building operations and new less miserable quarters were built towards the eastern part of the city where drainage of waste liquids was easiest in the 19th century and up to the 1930s the city was important for the production of railway locomotives and carriages iron pins needles buttons tobacco woollen goods and silk goods
