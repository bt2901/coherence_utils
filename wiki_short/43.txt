in february 1996 after well known former nbc executive and republican political strategist roger ailes left americas talking now msnbc murdoch called him to start the fox news channel ailes worked individuals through five months of 14 hour workdays and several weeks of rehearsal shows before launch on october 7 1996

at launch only 10 million households were able to watch fox news with none in the major media markets of new york city and los angeles according to published reports many media reviewers had to watch the first days programming at fox news studios because it was not readily available the rolling news coverage during the day consisted of 20 minute single topic shows like fox on crime or fox on politics surrounded by news headlines interviews had various facts at the bottom of the screen about the topic or the guest the flagship newscast at the time was called the schneider report with mike schneider giving a fast paced delivery of the news during the evening fox had opinion shows the oreilly report now the oreilly factor the crier report hosted by catherine crier and hannity  colmes

from the beginning fox news has placed heavy emphasis on visual presentation graphics were designed to be colorful and attention grabbing and to allow people to get the main points of what was being said even if they couldnt hear the host through the use of on screen text summarizing the position of the interviewer or speaker and bullet points when a host was giving commentary

fox news also created the fox news alert which interrupted regular programming when a breaking news story occurred

to accelerate its adoption by cable companies fox news paid systems up to 11 per subscriber to distribute the network this contrasted with the normal practice in which cable operators paid stations carriage fees for the programming of channels when time warner bought out ted turners turner broadcasting a federal antitrust consent decree required time warner to carry a second all news channel in addition to its own cnn time warner selected msnbc as the secondary news network instead of fox news fox news claimed that this violated an agreement to carry fox news citing its agreement to keep its us headquarters and a large studio in new york city news corporation pressured mayor rudolph giulianis administration to pressure time warner one of the citys two cable providers to transmit fox news on a city owned channel city officials threatened to take action affecting time warners cable franchises in the city

a lawsuit was filed by time warner against the city of new york claiming undue interference with and inappropriate use of the citys educational channels for commercial programming news corporation countered with an antitrust lawsuit against time warner for unfairly protecting cnn this led to an acrimonious battle between murdoch and turner with turner publicly comparing murdoch to adolf hitler while murdochs new york post ran an editorial questioning turners sanity giulianis motives were also questioned as his wife was a producer at murdoch owned wnyw tv in the end time warner and news corporation signed a settlement agreement to permit fox news to be carried on new york city cable system beginning in october 1997 and on all of time warners cable systems by 2001 though time warner still does not carry fox news in all areas in return time warner was given some rights to news corporations satellites in asia and europe to distribute time warner programming would receive the normal compensation per subscriber paid to cable operators and news corporation would not object to the continuation of atlanta braves baseball games being carried on tbs which could have expired because of the fox television networks contract with major league baseball
